    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 100 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAMC M.A.502 Component maintenance \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nComponent removal from and installation on an aircraft is considered to be aircraft maintenance and \nnot component maintenance. As a consequence, M.A.502 requirements do not apply to this case. \nAMC M.A.502(b) and (c) Component maintenance \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nM.A.502(b) and (c) allow the performance of certain component maintenance, in accordance with \ncomponent maintenance data, to maintenance organisations not holding the corresponding B/C \nrating and to independent certifying staff, subject to the agreement of: \n− The authority responsible for the oversight of the maintenance organisation (refer to M.1, \nparagraph 2 for M.A. Subpart F maintenance organisations, or to 145.1 for Part-145 \nmaintenance organisations, or to CAO.1 for Part-CAO maintenance organisations) or, \n− The authority of the Member State of registry in the case of maintenance performed by \nindependent certifying staff. \nThis should only be permitted by the competent authority in the case of simple component \nmaintenance, where the competent authority is satisfied that the certifying staff are appropriately \nqualified and the proper tooling and facilities are available. It is important to note that for more \ncomplex component maintenance, special qualifications may be required and it is not enough with \nholding a Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence. \nGM1 M.A.502(e) Component maintenance \nED Decision 2021/009/R \nA ‘declaration of maintenance accomplished’ is a certificate prepared in any shape/form by the person \nor organisation that performed any maintenance on the component covered by the certificate and \nsubject to the conditions in M.A.502(e). This person or organisation does not need an approval to \nperform maintenance in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. In order for the component \nto be eligible for installation with a ‘declaration of maintenance accomplished’, this declaration, \ntogether with other records, should allow the determination that the component was first installed as \n‘new’, as a component referred to in M.A.502(e). Such a component should not be installed in an \naircraft if there is information on the certificate which is not readable or not understandable or states \nthat the component is not in a satisfactory condition for operation. \nM.A.503 Life-limited parts and time-controlled components \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) Installed life-limited parts and time-controlled components shall not exceed the approved \nlimitation as specified in the AMP and ADs, except as provided for in point M.A.504(b). \n(b) When the approved limitation expires, the component shall be removed from the aircraft for \nmaintenance, or for disposal in the case of life-limited parts.

Such a template should be \nincluded in Part 5.1. \nb) Maintenance contractor selection procedure \nThis paragraph should describe how a maintenance contractor is selected by the \nCAMO. The selection procedure should describe the verification that the \nmaintenance organisation complies with Subpart E and also that the contractor has \nthe industrial capacity to undertake the required maintenance. The selection \nprocedure should preferably include a contract review process in order to ensure \nthat: \n− the contract is comprehensive and it contains no gaps or unclear areas, \n− everyone involved in the contract [both at the CAMO and at the \nmaintenance contractor] agrees with the terms of the contract and fully \nunderstands their responsibilities, \n− the functional responsibilities of all parties are clearly identified. \n6.2.2 Audit of aircraft \nThis paragraph should set out the procedures to perform an audit of an aircraft. It should \ndescribe the audit of aircraft before lease and the quality audit of aircraft during the lease \nperiod. \na) Audit of aircraft before lease \nThis audit should include an inspection of the aircraft and its records to ensure that \nthe aircraft is airworthy and it complies with the State of Registry requirements, \nPart-T and any EU requirement applicable for the intended operation. This should \ninclude checking that all emergency and operational equipment as required by EU \noperational and airspace rules is available, that all required maintenance and MSI \nhas been performed, that all modifications and repairs comply with the State of \nRegistry requirements and they are recorded, etc. \nb) Audit of aircraft during lease \nThis paragraph should set out the procedure to perform a quality audit of the \naircraft during the lease period. This procedure may include: \n− compliance with approved procedures, \n− contracted maintenance is carried out in accordance with the contract, \n− continued compliance with Part-T. ",

Certifying staff outside maintenance organisations (M.A.801(b)(1), or M.A.801(c)) \nthat release aircraft maintenance should send, with the agreement of the aircraft owner/lessee, \nany unserviceable component to a maintenance organisation for controlled storage. \nNevertheless, the person or organisation that declared the component unserviceable may \ntransfer its custody, after identifying it as unserviceable, to the aircraft owner/lessee provided \nthat such transfer is reflected in the aircraft logbook, or engine logbook, or component logbook. \n(b) ‘Secure location under the control of an approved maintenance organisation’ refers to a \nlocation that is managed by the approved maintenance organisation that prevents the \ncomponent from being reused or tampered with. This may include facilities that are established \nby the organisation at locations different from the main maintenance facilities. These locations \nshould be identified in the relevant procedures of the organisation. \n(c) In the case of unsalvageable components, the person or organisation should: \n(1) retain such components in the secure location referred to in paragraph (b); \n(2) arrange for the component to be mutilated in a manner that ensures that it is cannot be \nrestored for use, before disposing it; or \n(3) mark the component indicating that it is unsalvageable, when, in agreement with the \ncomponent owner, the component is disposed of for legitimate non-flight uses (such as \ntraining and education aids, research and development), or for non-aviation applications, \nmutilation is often not appropriate. Alternatively to marking, the original part number or \ndata plate information can be removed, or a record kept of the disposal of the component \nfor legitimate non-flight uses. \nGM1 M.A.504 Segregation of components \nED Decision 2019/009/R \nMUTILATION OF COMPONENTS \n(a) Mutilation should be accomplished in such a manner that the components become \npermanently unusable for their originally intended use. Mutilated components should not be \nable to be reworked or camouflaged to provide the appearance of being serviceable, such as by \nreplating, shortening and rethreading long bolts, welding, straightening, machining, cleaning, \npolishing, or repainting.

The operator should consult as necessary with \nthe person or organisation in charge of the airworthiness of the aircraft. \n(b) Depending on the aircraft defect and the status of the maintenance activity performed before \nthe flight, different scenarios are possible and are described below: \n(1) The aircraft maintenance manual (AMM), or any other maintenance data issued by the \nDAH or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance, requires that an MCF be \nperformed before completion of the maintenance ordered. In this scenario, a certificate \nafter incomplete maintenance, when in compliance with ML.A.801(f) or 145.A.50(e), \nshould be issued and the aircraft can be flown for this purpose under its airworthiness \ncertificate. \n1 \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related \nto air operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 296, 25.10.2012, p. 1) \n(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568896271265&uri=CELEX:32012R0965). ",
    " \nAnnex Vb (Part-ML) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1017 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nDue to incomplete maintenance, it is advisable to open a new entry into the ML.A.305 \naircraft logbook, to identify the need for an MCF. This new entry should contain or refer \nto, as necessary, data relevant to perform the MCF, such as aircraft limitations and any \npotential effect on operational and emergency equipment due to incomplete \nmaintenance, maintenance data reference and maintenance actions to be performed \nafter the flight. \nAfter a successful MCF, the maintenance records should be completed, the remaining \nmaintenance actions finalised and a certificate of release to service (CRS) issued. \n(2) Based on its own experience and for reliability considerations and/or quality assurance, \nan operator, owner, CAO or CAMO may wish to perform an MCF after the aircraft has \nundergone certain maintenance while maintenance data does not call for such a flight. \nTherefore, after the maintenance has been properly carried out, a CRS is issued and the \naircraft airworthiness certificate remains valid for this flight. \n(3) After troubleshooting of a system on the ground, an MCF is proposed by the maintenance \npersonnel or organisation as confirmation that the solution applied has restored the \nnormal system operation. During the maintenance performed, the maintenance \ninstructions are followed for the complete restoration of the system and therefore a CRS \nis issued before the flight. The airworthiness certificate is valid for the flight. An open \nentry requesting this flight may be recorded in the aircraft logbook. \n(4) An aircraft system has been found to fail, the dispatch of the aircraft is not possible in \naccordance with the maintenance data, and the satisfactory diagnosis of the cause of the \nfault can only be made in flight. The process for this troubleshooting is not described in \nthe maintenance data and therefore scenario (1) does not apply. Since the aircraft cannot \nfly under its airworthiness certificate because it has not been released to service after \nmaintenance, a permit to fly issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 is \nrequired. \nAfter the flight and the corresponding maintenance work, the aircraft can be released to \nservice and continue to operate under its original certificate of airworthiness. \n(c) For certain MCFs, the data obtained or verified in flight will be necessary for assessment or \nconsideration after the flight by the maintenance personnel or organisation prior to issuing the \nmaintenance release. For this purpose, when the maintenance staff cannot perform these \nfunctions in flight, it may rely on the crew performing the flight to complete this data or to make \nstatements about in-flight verifications. In this case, the maintenance staff should appoint the \ncrew personnel to play such a role on their behalf and, before the flight, brief the appointed \ncrew personnel on the scope, functions and the detailed process to be followed, including \nrequired reporting information after the flight and reporting means, in support of the final \nrelease to service to be issued by the certifying staff.

    " \nAnnex Vb (Part-ML) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1025 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(3) includes all mandatory continuing airworthiness information and any additional tasks \nderived from the assessment of the instructions issued by the DAH or the declarant of a \ndeclaration of design compliance; \n(4) justifies any deviations from the instructions issued by the DAH or the declarant of a \ndeclaration of design compliance; when those instructions are the basis for the AMP \ndevelopment, these deviations should not fall below the requirements of the MIP; and \n(5) is customised to the particular aircraft type, configuration and operation, in accordance \nwith ML.A.302(c)(5). \n(b) If the owner has not contracted a CAMO or CAO in order to manage the continuing \nairworthiness of the aircraft, then the owner is responsible for developing and declaring the \nmaintenance programme, assuming full responsibility for its content, and for any deviations \nfrom the instructions issued by the DAH or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance \n(ref. ML.A.201(f) and ML.A.302(c)(7)) and the possible consequences of such deviations. In this \ncase, these deviations do not need to be justified, but are to be identified in the AMP. However, \nthe maintenance programme still needs to comply with the requirements contained in \nML.A.302(c), in particular with the obligation to not fall below the requirements of the MIP and \nto comply with the mandatory continuing airworthiness information. \n(c) The content of the owner-declared maintenance programme cannot be challenged up front \neither by the competent authority or by the contracted maintenance organisation. This \ndeclared maintenance programme is the basis for adequate planning of maintenance, as well \nas for the ARs and the aircraft continuing airworthiness monitoring (ACAM) inspections in \naccordance with ML.B.303. Nevertheless, the maintenance programme will be subject to \nperiodic reviews at the occasion of the AR and, in case of discrepancies, linked with deficiencies \nin the content of the maintenance programme, the owner shall amend the maintenance \nprogramme accordingly, as required by ML.A.302(c)(9). \n(d) When the competent authority is notified of deficiencies linked with the content of the declared \nmaintenance programme for a particular aircraft (in case no agreement is reached between the \nowner and the AR staff about the changes required in the maintenance programme), the \ncompetent authority should contact the owner, request a copy of the maintenance programme, \ndecide which amendment to the AMP is necessary and raise the associated finding \n(ref. ML.A.302(c)(9)). If necessary, the competent authority may also react in accordance with \nML.B.304. Based on the information received, the reported deficiencies and the identified risks, \nthe competent authority may in addition adapt the ACAM programme accordingly \n(ref. ML.B.303). \n(e) Although there is no requirement for the owner to send a copy of the maintenance programme \nto the competent authority, this does not prevent the competent authority from requesting at \nany time the owner to send information about, or a copy of the AMP, even if deficiencies have \nnot been reported (see AMC1 ML.B.201). \n(f) Since the maintenance programme has to identify the alternatives tasks to the instructions \nissued by the DAH or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance, the ARs and ACAM \ninspections can place emphasis on the inspection of the areas affected by those deviations in \norder to make sure that the maintenance programme is effective. \n(g) Since the competent authority is not responsible for the content of a declared maintenance \nprogramme, the competent authority does not authorise the accomplishment of the scheduled \nmaintenance to deviate from the AMP content (other than the tolerances provided for in \nML.A.302(d)(1)). In such cases, the owner may declare an amended AMP. ",

Release to service and eligible persons \nOnly natural or legal persons entitled to release to service an aircraft after maintenance (see \nML.A.801(b)) are considered as an eligible installer responsible for the embodiment of a SC/SR \nwhen in compliance with applicable requirements. \nSince the design of the SC/SR does not require specific approval, the natural or legal person \nreleasing the embodiment of the change or repair takes the responsibility that the applicable \ncertification specifications within CS-STAN are fulfilled while being in compliance with Part-ML/ \nPart-M Subpart F/Part-CAO and/or Part-145 and not in conflict with the data issued by the TC \nholder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance. This includes responsibility in \nrespect of an adequate design, the selection/manufacturing of suitable parts and their \nidentification, documenting the change or repair, generation or amendment of aircraft manuals \nand instructions as needed, embodiment of the change/repair, releasing the aircraft to service \nand record-keeping. \nDepending on its nature, for certain SCs/SRs, CS-STAN might restrict the eligibility for the \nissuance of the release to service to certain persons (e.g. standard change/repair not suitable \nfor release to service by the pilot-owner). \nNOTE: Until 1 October 2020 (ref. entry into force of Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1142), it \nis possible to have aircraft maintenance released to service by the holder of an appropriate \ncertifying staff qualification valid in a Member State (national qualification). In this case, the \nfollowing conditions apply: \n− If the holder signs the release to service on behalf of a maintenance organisation, this \nrelease is valid regardless of the Member State where the aircraft is registered. \n− If the holder signs the release to service as an independent certifying staff, this release is \nonly valid in the Member State responsible for such certifying staff qualification and \nwhere the aircraft is registered. \n2. Parts and appliances to be installed as part of a SC/SR \nThe design of the parts and appliances to be used in a SC/SR is considered a part of the \nchange/repair, and, therefore, there is no need of a specific design approval. However, it is \npossible that for a particular SC, these certification specifications specifically require the use of \nparts and appliances that meet a technical standard. In this case, when the parts and appliances \nare required to be authorised as an ETSO article, other articles recognised as equivalent by \nmeans of an international safety agreement or grandfathered in accordance with Regulation \n(EU) No 748/2012 are equally acceptable. ",
    " \nAnnex Vb (Part-ML) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1056 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nNormally, a SC/SR shall not contain specifically designed parts that should be produced by a \nproduction organisation approved in accordance with Part 21 (POA). However, in the case that \nthe change or repair would contain such a part, it should be produced by an approved \nproduction organisation (POA holder), and delivered with an EASA Form 1. An arrangement in \naccordance with 21.A.122(b) is not applicable. \nEligibility for installation of parts and appliances belonging to a SC/SR is subject to compliance \nwith the Part 21, Part 21 Light and Part-ML and maintenance-organisation-related provisions, \nand the situation varies depending on the aircraft in/on which the SC/SR is to be embodied, and \nwho the installer is. The need for an EASA Form 1 is addressed in Part 21, Part 21 Light and Part- \nML, while less restrictive rules may, for instance, apply for ELA1 and ELA2 aircraft parts (e.g. \n21.A.307) and sailplane parts (e.g. AMC 21.A.303 of the ‘AMC and GM to Part 21’) or point \n21L.A.193 of Part 21 Light. Furthermore, Part-M Subpart F, Part-CAO and Part-145 contain \nprovisions (i.e. M.A.603(c), CAO.A.020(c) and 145.A.42(c)) that allow maintenance \norganisations to fabricate certain parts to be installed in/on the aircraft as part of their \nmaintenance activities. \n3. Identification of parts and appliances \nThe parts modified or installed during the embodiment of the SC/SR need to be permanently \nmarked in accordance with Part 21 Subpart Q or Part 21 Light Subpart Q. \n4. Documenting the SC/SR and declaring compliance with the certification specifications \nIn accordance with Part-ML, Part-M Subpart F, Part-CAO or Part-145 (e.g. ML.A.801(e), M.A.612, \nCAO.A.065 and 145.A.50(b)), the legal or natural person responsible for the embodiment of a \nchange or a repair should compile details of the work accomplished. In the case of SCs/SRs, this \nincludes, as necessary, based on the complexity, an engineering file containing drawings, a list \nof the parts and appliances used for the change or repair, supporting analysis and the results of \ntests performed or any other evidence suitable to show that the design fulfils the applicable \ncertification specifications within CS-STAN together with a statement of compliance and \namendments to aircraft manuals, to instructions for continuing airworthiness and to other \ndocuments such as aircraft parts list, wiring diagrams, etc. as deemed necessary. The EASA Form \n123 is prepared for the purpose of documenting the preparation and embodiment of the SC/SR. \nThe aircraft logbook should contain an entry referring to EASA Form 123; both EASA Form 123 \nand the release to service required after the embodiment of the SC/SR should be signed by the \nsame person. \nEASA Form 123 and all the records listed on it should follow elementary principles of controlled \ndocumentation, e.g. contain reference number of documents, issue dates, revision numbers, \nname of persons preparing/releasing the document, etc. \n5. Record-keeping \nThe legal or natural person responsible (see paragraph 1. above) for the embodiment of the \nchange/repair should keep the records generated with the SC/SR as required by Part-ML, Part- \nM Subpart F, Part-CAO or Part-145 and CS-STAN. \nIn addition, ML.A.305 requires that the aircraft owner (or CAMO or CAO, if a contract in \naccordance with ML.A.201 exists) keeps the status of the changes/repairs embodied in/on the \naircraft in order to control the aircraft configuration and manage its continuing airworthiness. \nWith regard to SCs/SRs, the information provided to the owner, CAMO or CAO may be listed in \nEASA Form 123 and should include, as required, a copy of any modified aircraft manual and/or \ninstructions for continuing airworthiness. All this information should normally be consulted ",

Instructions for continuing airworthiness (ICA) \nAs stipulated in ML.A.302, the aircraft owner, CAMO or CAO needs to assess if the changes in \nthe ICA of the aircraft require the amendment of the AMP. \n7. Embodiment of more than one SC \nThe embodiment of two or more related SCs described in Subpart B of CS-STAN is permitted as \na single change (the use of one EASA Form 123 only) as long as adequate references to and \nrecords of all SCs embodied are captured.

Dimensional information should be retained in the work \npack record. \n(e) The person issuing the CRS should use his or her normal signature except in the case where a \ncomputer release-to-service system is used. In this latter case, the competent authority needs \nto be satisfied that only this particular person may electronically issue the CRS. One such \nmethod of compliance is the use of a magnetic or optical personal card in conjunction with a \npersonal identification number (PIN) known only to the individual, which is keyed into the \ncomputer. A certification stamp is optional. \n(f) At the completion of all maintenance, owners, certifying staff, operators and maintenance \norganisations should ensure they have a clear, concise and legible record of the work \nperformed. \n(g) In the case of an ML.A.801(b)(2) CRS, the independent certifying staff should retain all records \nnecessary to prove that all requirements have been met for the issuance of a CRS. \nAMC1 ML.A.801(f) Aircraft certificate of release to service \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nCertain maintenance data issued by the DAH or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance \n(e.g. AMM) requires that a maintenance task be performed in flight as a necessary condition to \ncomplete the maintenance ordered. Within the aircraft limitations, the person authorised to certify \nthe maintenance per ML.A.801 should release the incomplete maintenance before this flight. GM1 \nML.A.301(f) describes the relations with the aircraft operator, which retains the responsibility for the \nMCF.

Storage \nconditions shall ensure segregation of unserviceable components and material from all other \ncomponents, material, equipment and tools. Storage conditions shall be in accordance with the \nmanufacturers' instructions and access shall be restricted to authorised personnel. \nAMC M.A.605(a) Facilities \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. Where a hangar is not owned by the M.A. Subpart F organisation, it may be necessary to \nestablish proof of tenancy. In addition, sufficiency of hangar space to carry out planned \nmaintenance should be demonstrated by the preparation of a projected aircraft hangar visit \nplan relative to the aircraft maintenance programme. The aircraft hangar visit plan should be \nupdated on a regular basis. \nFor balloons and airships, a hangar may not be required where maintenance of the envelope \nand bottom end equipment can more appropriately be performed outside, providing all \nnecessary maintenance can be accomplished in accordance with M.A.402 or ML.A.402. For \ncomplex repairs or component maintenance requiring an EASA Form 1, suitable approved \nworkshops should be provided. The facilities and environmental conditions required for \ninspection and maintenance should be defined in the Maintenance Organisation Manual. \nDepending on the scope of work of the maintenance organisation, it may not be necessary to \nhave a hangar available. For example, an organisation maintaining ELA2 aircraft (when not \nperforming major repairs) may perform the work in alternative suitable facilities (and possibly \nat remote locations) as agreed by the competent authority. \n2. Protection from the weather elements relates to the normal prevailing local weather elements \nthat are expected throughout any twelve-month period. Aircraft hangar and aircraft component \nworkshop structures should be to a standard that prevents the ingress of rain, hail, ice, snow, \nwind and dust etc. Aircraft hangar and aircraft component workshop floors should be sealed to \nminimise dust generation. \n3. Aircraft maintenance staff should be provided with an area where they may study maintenance \ninstructions and complete continuing airworthiness records in a proper manner. \n4. Special case for ELA2 aircraft \nFor ELA2 aircraft, it is acceptable not to have access to a hangar or dedicated workshops. \nDepending on the scope of work, other facilities are acceptable as long as protection is ensured \nfrom inclement weather and contamination. This may include, for example, working in the field \nor in non-aviation premises (closed or not). \nThese facilities do not need to be individually approved by the competent authority as long as \nthe maintenance organisation manual describes for each type of facility the scope of work, the \ntooling and equipment available, and the permitted environmental conditions (weather, \ncontamination). \nThe organisation should include, as part of the periodic internal organisational review, a \nsampling of the compliance with these conditions during certain maintenance events.

    " \nAnnex Vb (Part-ML) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX Vb (Part-ML)  Page 1077 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nin the conduct of pilot-owner maintenance must be included in the CRS in accordance with point \n(d) of point ML.A.803. \nThe pilot-owner must inform the contracted CAMO or CAO (if such contract exists) about the \ncompletion of the pilot-owner maintenance tasks no later than 30 days after completion of \nthese tasks in accordance with point (a) of point ML.A.305. \nAMC1 to Appendix II to Part-ML — Limited pilot-owner \nmaintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n(a) The lists below specifies items that may be expected to be completed by an owner who holds a \ncurrent and valid pilot licence for the aircraft type involved and who meets the competence and \nresponsibility requirements of Appendix II to Part-ML. \n(b) The list of tasks may not address in a detailed manner the specific needs of the various aircraft \ncategories. In addition, the development of technology and the nature of the operations \nundertaken by these categories of aircraft may not always be adequately considered. \n(c) Any other task meeting the requirements of Appendix II to Part-ML may also be performed by \nthe pilot-owner. \n(d) Therefore, the following lists are considered to meet the representative scope of limited pilot- \nowner maintenance referred to in ML.A.803 and Appendix II to Part-ML: \n(1) Part A applies to aeroplanes; \n(2) Part B applies to rotorcraft; \n(3) Part C applies to sailplanes and powered sailplanes; and \n(4) Part D applies to balloons and airships. \n(e) Inspection tasks/checks of any periodicity included in an approved maintenance programme \ncan be carried out provided that the specified tasks are compliant with the basic principles of \nAppendix II to Part-ML. \nThe content of periodic inspections/checks, as well as their periodicity, is not regulated or \nstandardised in an aviation specification. It is the decision of the DAH or the declarant of a \ndeclaration of design compliance to recommend a schedule for each specific type of \ninspection/check. \nFor an inspection/check with the same periodicity for different aircraft, the content may differ \nand in some cases, may be critically safety-related and need the use of special tools or \nknowledge and thus, not qualify for pilot-owner maintenance. Therefore, the maintenance \ncarried out by the pilot-owner should not be generalised to specific inspections such as of a 50- \nh, 100-h or 6-month periodicity. \nThe inspections to be carried out are limited to those areas and tasks listed in this AMC to \nAppendix II; this allows flexibility in the development of the maintenance programme and does \nnot limit the inspection to certain specific periodic inspections. A 50-h/6-month periodic \ninspection for a fixed-wing aeroplane as well as the 1-year inspection for a glider may normally \nbe eligible for pilot-owner maintenance. ",

The main objective of the assessment is to identify the \nstrengths and weaknesses to drive continual improvement. \nRemark: For ‘risk assessment’, please refer to the definition below. \nBase \nmaintenance \nRef. AMC1 145.A.10 \nCompetency is a combination of individual skills, practical and theoretical knowledge, attitudes, training, \nand experience. \nCorrection is the action to eliminate a detected non-compliance. \nCorrective \naction \nis the action to eliminate or mitigate the root cause(s) and prevent the recurrence of an \nexisting detected non-compliance, or other undesirable conditions or situations. Proper \ndetermination of the root cause(s) is crucial for defining effective corrective actions to \nprevent reoccurrence. \nError is an action or inaction by a person that may lead to deviations from accepted procedures \nor regulations. \nNote: Errors are often associated with occasions where a planned sequence of mental or \nphysical activities either fails to achieve its intended outcome, or is not appropriate with \nregard to the intended outcome, and when results cannot be attributed purely to chance. \nHazard is a condition or an object with the potential to cause or contribute to an aircraft incident or \naccident. \nHuman factors is anything that affects human performance, which means principles that apply to \naeronautical activities, and which seek safe interface between the human and other system \ncomponents by proper consideration of human performance. ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nGENERAL  Page 1093 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nHuman \nperformance \nrefers to human capabilities and limitations which have an impact on the safety and \nefficiency of aeronautical activities. \nInspection in the context of compliance monitoring and oversight, refers to an independent \ndocumented conformity evaluation by observation and judgement accompanied, as \nappropriate, by measurement, testing or gauging, in order to verify compliance with \napplicable requirements. \nNote: Inspection may be part of an audit (e.g. product audit), but may also be conducted \noutside the normal audit plan; for example, to verify closure of a particular finding. \nJust Culture Ref. Regulation (EU) No 376/2014, Article 2. \nLine \nmaintenance \nRef. AMC1 145.A.10 \nNear-miss is an event in which an occurrence to be mandatorily reported according to Regulation (EU) \nNo 376/2014 was narrowly averted or avoided. \nExample: A CAMO staff on rechecking his/her work at the end of a task realises that an AD, \nAWL, CMR task was not properly processed (for instance, in the AMP or continuing \nairworthiness record system) which would have led to a situation that the AD/AWL/CMR \nwould not have been performed on time on the affected (fleet of) aircraft. \nOrganisational \nfactor \nis a condition that affects the effectiveness of safety risk controls, related to the culture, \npolicies, processes, resources, and workplace of an organisation. \nOversight \nplanning cycle \nrefers to the time frame within which all areas of the approval and all processes should be \nreviewed by the competent authority by means of audits and inspections. \nOversight \nprogramme \nrefers to the detailed oversight schedule that defines the number of audits and inspections, \nthe scope and duration of each audit and inspection, including details of product audits and \nlocations, as appropriate, to be performed by the competent authority, and the tentative \ntime frame for performing each audit and inspection. \nPost holder means the person nominated in accordance with point CAMO.A.305(b)(2). \nPreventive \naction \nis the action to eliminate the cause of a potential non-compliance, or other undesirable \npotential situation. \nRisk assessment is an evaluation based on engineering and operational judgement and/or analysis methods \nin order to establish whether the achieved or perceived risk is acceptable or tolerable. \nSafety Culture is an enduring set of values, norms, attitudes, and practices within an organisation \nconcerned with minimising the exposure of the workforce and the general public to \ndangerous or hazardous conditions. In a positive safety culture, a shared concern for, \ncommitment to, and accountability for safety is promoted. \nSafety risk refers to the predicted probability and severity of the consequences or outcomes of a \nhazard. \nSafety training refers to dedicated training to support safety management policies and processes, including \nhuman factors training. \nNote: The main purpose of the safety training programme is to ensure that personnel at all \nlevels of the organisation maintain their competency to fulfil their roles safely. Safety \ntraining should, in particular, consider the safety knowledge derived from hazard \nidentification and risk management processes, and support the fostering of a positive safety \nculture.

The subcontracted organisation performs the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement tasks as an integral part of the CAMO’s management system, irrespective of any \nother approval held by the subcontracted organisation (including CAMO or Part-145 approval). \n(b) The CAMO remains accountable for the satisfactory completion of the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement tasks irrespective of any contract that may be established. \n(c) In order to fulfil this responsibility, the CAMO should be satisfied that the actions taken by the \nsubcontracted organisation meet the standards required by Part-CAMO. Therefore, the CAMO \nmanagement of such activities should be accomplished: \n(1) by active control through direct involvement; and/or \n(2) by endorsing the recommendations made by the subcontracted organisation. \n(d) In order to retain ultimate responsibility, the CAMO should limit subcontracted tasks to the \nactivities specified below: \n(1) airworthiness directive analysis and planning; \n(2) service bulletin analysis; \n(3) planning of maintenance; \n(4) reliability monitoring, engine health monitoring; \n(5) maintenance programme development and amendments; \n(6) any other activities, which do not limit the CAMO responsibilities, as agreed by the \ncompetent authority. ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION A — ORGANISATION \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1099 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(e) The CAMO’s controls associated with subcontracted continuing airworthiness management \ntasks should be reflected in the associated contract and be in accordance with the CAMO policy \nand procedures defined in the CAME. When such tasks are subcontracted, the management \nsystem is considered to be extended to the subcontracted organisations. \n(f) With the exception of engines and auxiliary power units, contracts would normally be limited \nto one organisation per aircraft type for any combination of the activities described in Appendix \nII. Where contracts are made with more than one organisation, the CAMO should demonstrate \nthat adequate coordination controls are in place and that the individuals’ responsibilities are \nclearly defined in the related contracts. \n(g) Contracts should not authorise the subcontracted organisation to subcontract to other \norganisations elements of the continuing airworthiness management tasks. \n(h) The competent authority should exercise oversight of the subcontracted activities through the \nCAMO approval. The contracts should be acceptable to the competent authority. The CAMO \nshould only subcontract to organisations which are specified by the competent authority on \nEASA Form 14. \n(i) The subcontracted organisation should agree to notify the CAMO of any changes affecting the \ncontract as soon as practical. The CAMO should then inform its competent authority. Failure to \ndo so may invalidate the competent authority’s acceptance of the contract. \n(j) Appendix II to AMC1 CAMO.A.125(d)(3) provides information on the subcontracting of \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks. \nGM1 CAMO.A.125(e) Terms of approval and privileges \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) An organisation may be approved for the privileges of point CAMO.A.125(d) only, without the \nprivilege to carry out airworthiness reviews. In this case, the airworthiness review can be \ncontracted to another appropriately approved organisation. It is not mandatory that this \ncontracted organisation is linked to an AOC holder, and it is possible to contract an \nappropriately approved independent CAMO which is approved for the same aircraft type. \n(b) In order to be approved for the privileges of point CAMO.A.125(e) for a particular aircraft type, \nit is necessary to be approved for the privileges of point CAMO.A.125(d) for that aircraft type. \n(c) Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the organisation needs to be currently \nmanaging an aircraft type in order to be able to perform airworthiness reviews on that aircraft \ntype. The organisation may be performing only airworthiness reviews on an aircraft type \nwithout having any customer under contract for that type. \n(d) Furthermore, this situation should not necessarily lead to the removal of the aircraft type from \nthe organisation approval. As a matter of fact, since in most cases the airworthiness review staff \nare not involved in continuing airworthiness management activities, it cannot be argued that \nthese airworthiness review staff are going to lose their skills just because the organisation is not \nmanaging a particular aircraft type. The important issue in relation to maintaining a particular \naircraft type in the organisation approval is whether the organisation continuously fulfils all the \nPart-CAMO requirements (facilities, documentation, qualified personnel, management system, \netc.) required for initial approval.

Establishing the root cause or causes of a \nnon-compliance often requires an overarching view of the events and circumstances that led to \nit, to identify all the possible systemic and contributing factors (regulatory, human factors (HF), \norganisational factors, technical, etc.) in addition to the direct factors. \n(b) A narrow focus on single events or failures, or the use of a simple, linear model, such as a fault \ntree, to identify the chain of events that led to the non-compliance, may not properly reflect \nthe complexity of the issue, and therefore there is a risk that important factors that must be \naddressed in order to prevent a reoccurrence will be ignored. \nSuch an inappropriate or partial causal analysis often leads to defining ‘quick fixes’ that only \naddress the symptoms of the non-conformity. A peer review of the results of the causal analysis \nmay increase its reliability and objectivity. \n(c) A system description of the organisation that considers the organisational structures, processes \nand their interfaces, procedures, staff, equipment, facilities and the environment in which the \norganisation operates, will support both effective causal (reactive) and hazard (proactive) \nanalyses. \nCAMO.A.155 Immediate reaction to a safety problem \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1383 \nThe organisation shall implement: \n(a) any safety measures mandated by the competent authority in accordance with point \nCAMO.B.135; \n(b) any relevant mandatory safety information issued by the Agency.

Safety management enables an organisation to \nmanage its activities in a more systematic and focused manner. When an organisation has a clear \nunderstanding of its role and contribution to aviation safety, it can prioritise safety risks and more \neffectively manage its resources and obtain optimal results. \nThe principles of the requirements in points CAMO.A.200, CAMO.A.202, CAMO.A.205 and the related \nAMC constitute the EU management system framework for aviation safety management. This \nframework addresses the core elements of the ICAO safety management system (SMS) framework ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION A — ORGANISATION \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1108 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ndefined in Appendix 2 to Annex 19, and it promotes an integrated approach to the management of an \norganisation. It facilitates the introduction of the additional safety management components, building \nupon the existing management system, rather than adding them as a separate framework. \nThis approach is intended to encourage organisations to embed safety management and risk-based \ndecision-making into all their activities, instead of superimposing another system onto their existing \nmanagement system and governance structure. In addition, if the organisation holds multiple \norganisation certificates within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, it may choose to implement \na single management system to cover all of its activities. An integrated management system may not \nonly be used to capture multiple certification requirements, but also to cover other business \nmanagement systems such as security, occupational health and environmental management systems. \nIntegration will remove any duplication and exploit synergies by managing safety risks across multiple \nactivities. Organisations may determine the best means to structure their management systems to \nsuit their business and organisational needs. \nThe core part of the management system framework (CAMO.A.200) focuses on what is essential for \nsafety management, by mandating the organisation to: \n(a) clearly define accountabilities and responsibilities; \n(b) establish a safety policy and the related safety objectives; \n(c) implement safety reporting procedures in line with just culture principles; \n(d) ensure the identification of aviation safety hazards entailed by its activities, ensure their \nevaluation, and the management of associated risks, including: \n(1) taking actions to mitigate the risks; \n(2) verifying the effectiveness of the actions taken to mitigate the risks; \n(e) monitor compliance, while considering any additional requirements that are applicable to the \norganisation; \n(f) keep their personnel trained, competent, and informed about significant safety issues; and \n(g) document all the key management system processes. \nCompared to the previous Part-M Subpart G quality system ‘framework’, the new elements that are \nintroduced with Part-CAMO are, in particular, those addressed under points (b) to (d). Points (c) and \n(d)(1) address component 2 ‘Safety Risk Management’ of the ICAO SMS framework. Points (d)(2) and \n(e) address component 3 ‘Safety Assurance’ thereof. \nPoint CAMO.A.200 defines the following as key safety management processes; these are further \nspecified in the related AMC and GM: \n− Hazard identification; \n− Safety risk management; \n− Internal investigation; \n− Safety performance monitoring and measurement; \n− Management of change; \n− Continuous improvement; \n− Immediate safety action and coordination with the aircraft operator’s Emergency Response \nPlan (ERP). ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION A — ORGANISATION \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1109 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nIt is important to recognise that safety management will be a continuous activity, as hazards, risks and \nthe effectiveness of safety risk mitigations will change over time. \nThese key safety management processes are supported by a compliance monitoring function as an \nintegral part of the management system for safety. Most aviation safety regulations constitute generic \nsafety risk controls established by the ‘regulator’. Therefore, ensuring effective compliance with the \nregulations during daily operations and independent monitoring of compliance are fundamental to \nany management system for safety. The compliance monitoring function may, in addition, support the \nfollow-up of safety risk mitigation actions. Moreover, where non-compliances are identified through \ninternal audits, the causes will be thoroughly assessed and analysed. Such an analysis in return \nsupports the risk management process by providing insights into causal and contributing factors, \nincluding HF, organisational factors and the environment in which the organisation operates. In this \nway, the outputs of compliance monitoring become some of the various inputs to the safety risk \nmanagement functions. On the other hand, the safety risk management processes may be used to \ndetermine focus areas for compliance monitoring. In this way, internal audits will inform the \norganisation’s management of the level of compliance within the organisation, whether safety risk \nmitigation actions have been implemented, and where corrective or preventive action is required. The \ncombination of safety risk management and compliance monitoring should lead to an enhanced \nunderstanding of the end-to-end process and the process interfaces, exposing opportunities for \nincreased efficiencies, which are not limited to safety aspects. \nAs aviation is a complex system with many organisations and individuals interacting together, the \nprimary focus of the key safety management processes is on the organisational processes and \nprocedures, but it also relies on the humans in the system. The organisation and the way in which it \noperates can have a significant impact on human performance. Therefore, safety management \nnecessarily addresses how humans can contribute both positively and negatively to an organisation’s \nsafety outcomes, recognising that human behaviour is influenced by the organisational environment. \nThe effectiveness of safety management largely depends on the degree of commitment of the senior \nmanagement to create a working environment that optimises human performance and encourages \npersonnel to actively engage in and contribute to the organisation’s management processes. Similarly, \na positive safety culture relies on a high degree of trust and respect between the personnel and the \nmanagement, and it must therefore be created and supported at the senior management level. If the \nmanagement does not treat individuals who identify hazards and report adverse events in a \nconsistently fair and just way, those individuals are unlikely to be willing to communicate safety issues \nor to work with the management to effectively address the safety risks. As with trust, a positive safety \nculture takes time and effort to establish, and it can be easily lost. \nIt is further recognised that the introduction of processes for hazard identification and risk \nassessment, mitigation and verification of the effectiveness of such mitigation actions will create \nimmediate and direct costs, while related benefits are sometimes intangible and may take time to \nmaterialise. Over time, an effective management system will not only address the risks of major \noccurrences, but also identify and address production inefficiencies, improve communication, foster \na better organisation culture, and lead to more effective control of contractors and suppliers. In \naddition, through an improved relationship with the authority, an effective management system may \nresult in a reduced oversight burden. \nThus, by viewing safety management and the related organisational policies and key processes as \nitems that are implemented not only to prevent incidents and accidents, but also to meet the \norganisation’s strategic objectives, any investment in safety should be seen as an investment in \nproductivity and organisational success.

Effective \norganisations seek to improve their processes, with conscious recognition that changes can \nexpose the organisation to potentially latent hazards and risks if they are not properly and \neffectively managed. \n(b) Regardless of the magnitude of change, large or small, its safety implications should always be \nproactively considered. This is primarily the responsibility of the team that proposes and/or \nimplements the change. However, a change can only be successfully implemented if all the \npersonnel affected by the change are engaged, are involved and participate in the process. The \nmagnitude of a change, its safety criticality, and its potential impact on human performance \nshould be assessed in any change management process. \n(c) The process for the management of change typically provides principles and a structured \nframework for managing all aspects of the change. Disciplined application of the management \nof change can maximise the effectiveness of the change, engage the staff, and minimise the \nrisks that are inherent in a change. \n(d) The introduction of a change is the trigger for the organisation to perform their hazard \nidentification and risk management process. \nSome examples of change include, but are not limited to: \n(1) changes to the organisational structure; \n(2) the inclusion of a new aircraft type in the terms of approval; \n(3) the addition of aircraft of the same or a similar type; \n(4) significant changes in personnel (affecting key personnel and/or large numbers of \npersonnel, high turn-over); \n(5) new or amended regulations; \n(6) changes in the security arrangements; \n(7) changes in the economic situation of an organisation (e.g. commercial or financial \npressure); ",

For \nexample, changes in computer systems, equipment, technology, personnel changes, including \nchanges in management personnel, procedures, work organisation, or work processes are likely \nto affect performance. \n(f) The purpose of integrating HF into the management of change is to minimise potential risks by \nspecifically considering the impact of the change on the people within a system. \n(g) Special consideration, including any HF issues, should be given to the ‘transition period’. In \naddition, the activities utilised to manage these issues should be integrated into the change \nmanagement plan. \n(h) Effective management of change should be supported by the following: \n(1) Implementation of a process for formal hazard identification/risk assessment for major \noperational changes, major organisational changes, changes in key personnel, and \nchanges that may affect the way continuing airworthiness management is carried out. \n(2) Identification of changes that are likely to occur in business which would have a \nnoticeable impact on: \n(i) resources — material and human; \n(ii) management direction — policies, processes, procedures, training; and \n(iii) management control. \n(3) Safety cases/risk assessments that are aviation-safety focused. \n(4) Involvement of key stakeholders in the change management process as appropriate. \n(i) During the management of change process, previous risk assessments, and existing \nhazards are reviewed for possible effect. \nAMC1 CAMO.A.200(a)(4) Management system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nCOMMUNICATION ON SAFETY \n(a) The organisation should establish communication about safety matters that: \n(1) ensures that all personnel are aware of the safety management activities, as appropriate, \nfor their safety responsibilities; \n(2) conveys safety-critical information, especially related to assessed risks and analysed \nhazards; \n(3) explains why particular actions are taken; and \n(4) explains why safety procedures are introduced or changed. \n(b) Regular meetings with personnel at which information, actions, and procedures are discussed, \nmay be used to communicate safety matters.

AMC1 CAMO.A.300, Part 2 ‘Management system \nprocedures’). Organisations that hold multiple organisation certificates within the scope of \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1139 may prefer to use a separate manual in order to avoid duplication. \nThat manual or the CAME, depending on the case, should be the key instrument for \ncommunicating the approach to the management system for the whole of the organisation. \n(b) The organisation may also choose to document some of the information that is required to be \ndocumented in separate documents (e.g. policy documents, procedures). In that case, it should \nensure that the manual or the CAME contains adequate references to any document that is kept \nseparately.

It should include some product sampling as this is the end result of \nthe process. \n(c) The independent audit should provide an objective overview of the complete set of continuing \nairworthiness management-related activities. \n(d) The organisation should establish an audit plan to show when and how often the activities as \nrequired by Part-M, Part-ML and Part-CAMO will be audited. \n(e) The audit plan should ensure that all aspects of Part-CAMO compliance are verified every year, \nincluding all the subcontracted activities, and the auditing may be carried out as a complete \nsingle exercise or subdivided over the annual period. The independent audit should not require \neach procedure to be verified against each product line when it can be shown that the particular \nprocedure is common to more than one product line and the procedure has been verified every \nyear without resultant findings. Where findings have been identified, the particular procedure \nshould be verified against other product lines until the findings have been closed, after which \nthe independent audit procedure may revert to a yearly interval for the particular procedure. \n(f) Provided that there are no safety-related findings, the audit planning cycle specified in this AMC \nmay be increased by up to 100 %, subject to a risk assessment and/or mitigation actions, and \nagreement by the competent authority. \n(g) Where the organisation has more than one location approved, the audit plan should ensure \nthat each location is audited every year or at an interval determined through a risk assessment \nagreed by the competent authority and not exceeding the applicable audit planning cycle. \n(h) A report should be issued each time an audit is carried out describing what was checked and \nthe resulting non-compliance findings against applicable requirements and procedures. \nAMC3 CAMO.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — CONTRACTING OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDIT \n(a) If external personnel are used to perform independent audits: \n(1) any such audits are performed under the responsibility of the compliance monitoring \nmanager; and \n(2) the organisation remains responsible for ensuring that the external personnel have the \nrelevant knowledge, background, and experience that are appropriate to the activities \nbeing audited, including knowledge and experience in compliance monitoring. \n(b) The organisation retains the ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness of the compliance \nmonitoring function, in particular for the effective implementation and follow-up of all \ncorrective actions.

The feedback part of the compliance monitoring function should \ndefine who is required to address any non-compliance in each particular case, and the \nprocedure to be followed if the corrective action is not completed within the defined time \nframe. The principal functions of the feedback system are to ensure that all findings resulting \nfrom the independent audits of the organisation are properly investigated and corrected in a \ntimely manner, and to enable the accountable manager to be kept informed of any safety issues \nand the extent of compliance with Part-CAMO. \n(d) The independent audit reports referred to in AMC2 CAMO.A.200(a)(6) should be sent to the \nrelevant department(s) for corrective action, giving target closure dates. These target dates \nshould be discussed with the relevant department(s) before the compliance monitoring \nfunction confirms the dates in the report. The relevant department(s) are required to \nimplement the corrective action and inform the compliance monitoring function of the status \nof the implementation of the action. \n(e) Unless the review of the results from compliance monitoring is the responsibility of the safety \nreview board (ref. AMC1 CAMO.A.200(a)(1) point (b)(4)), the accountable manager should hold \nregular meetings with staff to check the progress of any corrective actions. These meetings may \nbe delegated to the compliance monitoring manager on a day-to-day basis, provided that the \naccountable manager: \n(1) meets the senior staff involved at least twice per year to review the overall performance \nof the compliance monitoring function; and \n(2) receives at least a half-yearly summary report on non-compliance findings. \n(f) All records pertaining to the independent audit and the feedback system should be retained for \nthe period specified in point CAMO.A.220(b) or for such periods as to support changes to the \naudit planning cycle in accordance with AMC2 CAMO.A.200(a)(6), whichever is the longer. \nGM1 CAMO.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING FUNCTION \nThe compliance monitoring function is one of the elements that is required to be in compliance with \nthe applicable requirements.

Non-destructive testing means such testing specified by the type certificate holder of the \naircraft, engine or propeller in the M.A.401(b) or ML.A.401(b) maintenance data for in service \naircraft/aircraft components for the purpose of determining the continued fitness of the \nproduct to operate safely. \n2. Appropriately qualified means to level 1, 2 or 3 as defined by European Standard EN 4179 \ndependent upon the non-destructive testing function to be carried out. \n3. Notwithstanding the fact that level 3 personnel may be qualified via EN 4179 to establish and \nauthorise methods, techniques, etc., this does not permit such personnel to deviate from \nmethods and techniques published in the maintenance data, unless the maintenance data \nexpressly permits such deviation. \n4. Notwithstanding the general references in EN 4179 to a national aerospace NDT board, all \nexaminations should be conducted by personnel or organisations under the general control of \nsuch a board. In the absence of a national aerospace NDT board, examinations should be \nconducted by personnel or organisations under the general control of the NDT board of a \nMember State designated by the competent authority. \n5. Particular non-destructive test means any one or more of the following: dye penetrant, \nmagnetic particle, eddy current, ultrasonic and radiographic methods including X ray and \ngamma ray. \n6. In addition it should be noted that new methods are and will be developed, such as, but not \nlimited to thermography and shearography, which are not specifically addressed by EN 4179. \nUntil such time as an agreed standard is established such methods should be carried out in \naccordance with the particular equipment manufacturers’ recommendations including any \ntraining and examination process to ensure competence of the personnel with the process. \n7. Any approved maintenance organisation that carries out continued airworthiness non- \ndestructive testing should establish qualification procedures for non-destructive testing. \n8. Boroscoping and other techniques such as delamination coin tapping are non-destructive \ninspections rather than non-destructive testing. Notwithstanding such differentiation, \napproved maintenance organisation should establish a procedure to ensure that personnel who \ncarry out and interpret such inspections are properly trained and assessed for their competence \nwith the process. Non-destructive inspections, not being considered as non-destructive testing \nby M.A. Subpart F are not listed in Appendix IV to Part-M under class rating D1. \n9. The referenced standards, methods, training and procedures should be specified in the \nmaintenance organisation manual. \n10. Any such personnel who intend to carry out and/or control a non-destructive test for which \nthey were not qualified prior to the effective date of Part-M should qualify for such non- \ndestructive test in accordance with EN 4179. \nIn this context officially recognised standard means those standards established or published by an \nofficial body whether having legal personality or not, which are widely recognised by the air transport \nsector as constituting good practice.

The lines of responsibility and accountability of the \norganisation that holds an air operator certificate (AOC) and a CAMO approval are linked \ndirectly to the corporate authority of the operator’s accountable manager. This may be \nsupported by a common manual (e.g. a common safety management manual). \n(c) If organisations forming part of a single air carrier business grouping decide to facilitate the \nharmonisation of their management systems through standards, those standards will cover the \ncommon or consistent methods and procedures. Other elements of the management system \nmay be covered at the discretion of the organisation, to provide flexibility and thus leverage \nsynergy or cooperation. Harmonising management systems requires extensive and continuous \nexchange of information on hazard identification, safety risk management methods, strategic \ndecisions, safety actions, compliance monitoring, and best practices. \n(d) Within a single air carrier business grouping, the CAMO plays a key role in the cooperation \nbetween the operators that use that CAMO, and in the harmonisation of their management \nsystems. \n(e) Contracting a CAMO in accordance with point M.A.201(ea) implies that at least two operators \nwill use that CAMO. As the operators’ management systems should be harmonised with the \nCAMO’s management system, they will also be harmonised with one another. \nCAMO.A.200A Information security management system \nRegulation (EU) 2023/203 \nIn addition to the management system referred to in point CAMO.A.200, the organisation shall \nestablish, implement and maintain an information security management system in accordance with \nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2023/203 in order to ensure the proper management of information \nsecurity risks which may have an impact on aviation safety. \n[Applicable from 22 February 2026 – Regulation (EU) 2023/203] ",

    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION A — ORGANISATION \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1150 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(b) The CAMO bears the responsibility for the airworthy condition of the aircraft for which it \nperforms the continuing airworthiness management. Thus, it should be satisfied before the \nintended flight that all required maintenance has been properly carried out. \n(c) The CAMO should agree with the operator on the process to select a maintenance organisation \nbefore concluding any contract with a maintenance organisation. \n(d) The fact that the CAMO has contracted a maintenance organisation should not prevent it from \nchecking at the maintenance facilities on any aspect of the contracted work to fulfil its \nresponsibility for the airworthiness of the aircraft. \n(e) The contract between the CAMO and the maintenance organisation(s) should specify in detail \nthe responsibilities and the work to be performed by each party. \n(f) Both the specification of work and the assignment of responsibilities should be clear, \nunambiguous and sufficiently detailed to ensure that no misunderstanding arises between the \nparties concerned that could result in a situation where work that has an effect on the \nairworthiness or serviceability of aircraft is not or will not be properly performed. \n(g) Special attention should be paid to procedures and responsibilities to ensure that all \nmaintenance work is performed, service bulletins are analysed, and decisions are taken on their \naccomplishment, airworthiness directives are accomplished on time and that all work, including \nnon-mandatory modifications, is carried out to approved or declared (in accordance with Part \n21 Light Subpart C) data and to the latest standards. \n(h) Appendix IV to AMC1 CAMO.A.315(c) gives further details on the subject. \nAMC2 CAMO.A.315(c) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nMAINTENANCE CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER CAMO/OPERATOR \n(a) The purpose of point CAMO.A.315(c) is to ensure that all maintenance is carried out by an \nappropriately approved maintenance organisation. It is acceptable to contract another \noperator/CAMO (secondary operator/CAMO) that does not hold a maintenance organisation \napproval when it proves that such a contract is in the interest of the CAMO by simplifying the \nmanagement of its maintenance, and the CAMO keeps an appropriate control of it. In this case, \nthe CAME should include appropriate procedures to ensure that all maintenance is ultimately \ncarried out on time by approved maintenance organisations in accordance with appropriate \nmaintenance data. In particular, the compliance monitoring and safety risk management \nprocedures should place great emphasis on monitoring compliance with the above and ensuring \nproper hazard identification, and management of risks associated with such contracting. The \nlist of approved maintenance organisations, or a reference to this list, should be included in the \nCAME. \n(b) This contract should not preclude the CAMO from ensuring that all maintenance is performed \nby appropriately approved organisations which comply with M.A.201 or ML.A.201. Typical \narrangements are the following: \n− Component maintenance: \nThe CAMO may find it more appropriate to have a primary contractor (the secondary \noperator/CAMO) dispatching the components to appropriately approved organisations \nrather than sending themselves different types of components to various maintenance \norganisations approved under Part-145. The benefit for the CAMO is that the \nmanagement of maintenance is simplified by having a single point of contact for ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION A — ORGANISATION \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1151 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ncomponent maintenance. The CAMO remains responsible for ensuring that all \nmaintenance is performed by maintenance organisations approved under Part-145 and \nin accordance with appropriate maintenance data. \n− Aircraft, engine and component maintenance: \nThe CAMO may wish to have a maintenance contract with a secondary operator/CAMO \nnot approved as maintenance organisation for the same type of aircraft. A typical case is \nthat of a dry-leased aircraft between operators where the parties, for consistency or \ncontinuity reasons (especially for short-term lease agreements), find it appropriate to \nkeep the aircraft under the current maintenance arrangement. Where this arrangement \ninvolves various maintenance organisations, it might be more manageable for the lessee \nCAMO to have a single maintenance contract with the lessor operator/CAMO. Whatever \ntype of acceptable maintenance contract is concluded, the CAMO is required to exercise \nthe same level of control on contracted maintenance, particularly through the person(s) \nnominated under point CAMO.A.305(a) and the management system as referred to in \nCAMO.A.200. \nGM1 CAMO.A.315(c) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nLINE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT \nFor line maintenance, the actual layout of the IATA Standard Ground Handling Agreement may be \nused as a basis, but this does not preclude the CAMO from ensuring that the content of the contract \nis acceptable and especially that the contract allows the CAMO to properly exercise its continuing \nairworthiness management responsibility. Those parts of the contract that have no effect on the \ntechnical or operational aspects of airworthiness are outside the scope of this paragraph. \nGM1 CAMO.A.315(d) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nWORK ORDERS \nThe intent of this paragraph is that maintenance contracts are not necessary when the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition specifies that the relevant maintenance activity may be \nordered through one-time work orders. This includes unscheduled line maintenance and may also \ninclude component maintenance up to engines, as long as the maintenance is manageable through \nwork orders, in terms of both volume and complexity. It should be noted that this paragraph implies \nthat even where base maintenance is ordered on a case-by-case basis, there should be a written \nmaintenance contract. \nCAMO.A.320 Airworthiness review \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1383 \nWhen the organisation approved in accordance with point (e) of point CAMO.A.125 performs \nairworthiness reviews, they shall be performed in accordance with point M.A.901 of Annex I (Part-M) \nor point ML.A.903 of Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable.

Different competent authorities may not necessarily use the same tool \nto assess the maturity of the harmonised management systems. However, they will \ncoordinate on this matter and share with one another to which extent their assessment \napproach follows the principles that are set out in GM1 CAMO.B.300(a);(b);(c). This way, \nall competent authorities involved will have an overall understanding of how each \ncompetent authority evaluates compliance and effectiveness of the management \nsystem(s). \n(2) When a finding is raised on a harmonised procedure or, if used, on a group standard, the \nother competent authority(ies) is/are informed, and the related root cause analysis and \ncorrective action plan that are developed by the operator(s) and CAMO concerned are \nshared with all competent authorities involved. In addition, the informed competent \nauthority(ies) will assess if such a finding is relevant for the organisation under its/their \noversight and, depending on the conclusion of such an assessment, will take appropriate \naction (e.g. take no action, communicate with the organisation or with the competent \nauthority that raised the finding, or raise a finding itself/themselves). \n(c) Regarding the duration of the oversight planning cycle of the organisations whose management \nsystems are harmonised: \n(1) even if the management systems of organisations are harmonised with each other, the \nmaturity levels of those management systems may differ; as the oversight planning cycle \nis mainly driven by the management system’s maturity and the organisation’s compliance ",

An aircraft component which has been maintained off the aircraft requires the issuance of a \nCRS for such maintenance and another CRS in regard to being installed properly on the aircraft \nwhen such action occurs. When an organisation maintains a component for use by the same \norganisation, an EASA Form 1 may not be necessary depending upon the organisation’s internal \nrelease procedures defined in the maintenance organisation exposition. \n2. In the case of components in storage prior to Part-145, Part-M and Part-21 and not released on \nan EASA Form 1 or equivalent in accordance with M.A.501(a) or removed serviceable from a \nserviceable aircraft which have been withdrawn from service, this paragraph provides \nadditional guidance regarding the conditions under which an EASA Form 1 may be issued. \n2.1. An EASA Form 1 may be issued for an aircraft component which has been: \n− Maintained before Part-145, or Part-M became effective or manufactured before \nPart-21 became effective. \n− Used on an aircraft and removed in a serviceable condition. Examples include \nleased and loaned aircraft components. \n− Removed from aircraft which have been withdrawn from service, or from aircraft \nwhich have been involved in abnormal occurrences such as accidents, incidents, \nheavy landings or lightning strikes. \n− Components maintained by an unapproved organisation. \n2.2. An appropriately rated M.A. Subpart F maintenance organisation may issue an EASA Form \n1 as detailed in this AMC subparagraph 2.5 to 2.9, as appropriate, in accordance with the \nprocedures detailed in the manual as approved by the competent authority. The \nappropriately rated M.A. Subpart F maintenance organisation is responsible for ensuring \nthat all reasonable measures have been taken to ensure that only approved and \nserviceable aircraft components are issued an EASA Form 1 under this paragraph. \n2.3. For the purposes of this paragraph 2 only, ‘appropriately rated’ means an organisation \nwith an approval class rating for the type of component or for the product in which it may \nbe installed. \n2.4. An EASA Form 1 issued in accordance with this paragraph 2 should be issued by signing \nin block 14b and stating ‘Inspected/Tested’ in block 11. In addition, block 12 should \nspecify: \n2.4.1. when the last maintenance was carried out and by whom; \n2.4.2. if the component is unused, when the component was manufactured and by whom \nwith a cross-reference to any original documentation which should be included \nwith the Form; \n2.4.3. a list of all ADs, repairs and modifications known to have been incorporated. If no \nADs or repairs or modifications are known to be incorporated then this should be \nso stated; \n2.4.4. detail of life used for life-limited parts and time-controlled components being any \ncombination of fatigue, overhaul or storage life; \n2.4.5. for any aircraft component having its own maintenance history record, reference \nto the particular maintenance history record as long as the record contains the ",

For \nexample, it will be necessary to determine whether one large team audit, a short series of small \nteam audits, or a long series of single inspector audits is most appropriate for the particular \nsituation. \n(b) The audit may be structured so as to verify the organisation’s processes related to a product \nline. For example, in the case of an organisation with Airbus A320 and Airbus A310 ratings, the \naudit should concentrate on the continuing airworthiness management processes of one type \nonly for a full compliance check, and depending upon the result, the second type may only \nrequire a sample check against those aspects that were seen to be weak regarding compliance \nfor the first type. \n(c) In determining the scope of the audit and which activities of the organisation will be assessed \nduring the audit, the privileges of the approved organisation should be taken into account, e.g. \ntheir approval to carry out airworthiness reviews. \n(d) The competent authority auditing inspector should always ensure that he or she is accompanied \nthroughout the audit by a senior member of the organisation, who is normally the compliance \nmonitoring manager. The reason for being accompanied is to ensure that the organisation is \nfully aware of any findings raised during the audit. \n(e) At the end of the audit, the auditing inspector should inform the senior member of the \norganisation of all the findings that were raised during the audit. \nAMC1 CAMO.B.310(c) Initial certification procedure \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) There may be occasions when the competent authority inspector is unsure about the \ncompliance of some aspects of the applicant's organisation. If this occurs, the inspector should \ninform the organisation about the possible non-compliance at the time, and about the fact that \nthe situation will be reviewed within the competent authority before a decision is made. If the \nreview concludes that there is no finding, then a verbal confirmation to the organisation should \nsuffice. ",

Subsequent to the on-site audit that identified the particular findings, the \ncompetent authority should review the provisional finding levels, adjusting them if necessary, \nand should change the categorisation from ‘provisional’ to ‘confirmed’. \nAMC2 CAMO.B.310(c) Initial certification procedure \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) The audit should be recorded using the audit report EASA Form 13-CAMO (Appendix V to AMC2 \nCAMO.B.310(c)). \n(b) A review of the EASA Form 13-CAMO audit report should be carried out by a competent \nindependent person nominated by the competent authority. The review should take into \naccount the relevant points of Part-CAMO, the categorisation of the finding levels and the \nclosure action that was taken. A satisfactory review of the audit report should be indicated by \na signature on EASA Form 13-CAMO. \n(c) The audit reports should include the date when each finding was closed, together with a \nreference to the competent authority report or letter that confirmed the closure. \nAMC1 CAMO.B.310(d) Initial certification procedure \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nAll findings should be confirmed in writing to the applicant organisation within 2 weeks of the on-site \naudit. \nGM1 CAMO.B.310(e)(1); CAMO.B.330 Initial certification procedure \nand changes \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nTERMS OF APPROVAL \nThe table shown for the terms of approval in EASA Form 14 includes a field designated as ‘Aircraft \ntype/series/group’. \nThe intention is to give maximum flexibility to the competent authority to customise the approval to \na particular organisation. \nPossible alternatives to be included in this field are the following: \n− A specific type designation that is part of a type certificate, such as Airbus 340-211 or Cessna \n172R. \n− A type rating (or series) as listed in Part-66 Appendix I to AMC, which may be further subdivided, \nsuch as Boeing 737-600/700/800, Boeing 737-600, Cessna 172 Series. \n− An aircraft group such as, for example, ‘all sailplanes and powered sailplanes’ or ‘Cessna single \npiston engine aircraft’ or ‘Group 3 aircraft’ (as defined in 66.A.5) or ‘aircraft below 2 730 kg \nMTOM’. \nReference to the engine type installed in the aircraft may or may not be included, as necessary. \nIt is important to note that the terms of approval defined in EASA Form 14 is further limited to the \nscope of work defined in the CAME. It is this scope of work in the CAME which ultimately defines the \napproval of the organisation. As a consequence, it is possible for a competent authority to endorse in ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nSECTION B — AUTHORITY \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 1182 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nEASA Form 14, for example, a scope of work for Group 3 aircraft while the detailed scope of work \ndefined in the CAME does not include all Group 3 aircraft. \nNevertheless, in all cases, the competent authority should be satisfied that the organisation has the \ncapability of managing the types/groups/series endorsed in EASA Form 14. \nSince the activities linked to continuing airworthiness management are mainly process-oriented rather \nthan facility/tooling-oriented, changes to the detailed scope of work defined in the CAME (either \ndirectly or through a capability list), within the limits already included in EASA Form 14, may be \nconsidered as not affecting the approval and not subject to point CAMO.A.130(a). As a consequence, \nfor these changes, the competent authority may allow the use by the CAMO of the procedure referred \nto in point CAMO.A.130(c) for changes not requiring prior approval. \nSince, as mentioned above, the competent authority should make sure that the organisation is capable \nof managing the requested category as a whole, it is not reasonable to grant a full Group 3 approval \nbased on an intended scope of work which is limited to, for example, a Cessna 172 aircraft. However, \nit may be reasonable to grant such full Group 3 approval, after showing appropriate capability, for an \nintended scope of work covering several aircraft types or series of different complexity and which are \nrepresentative of the full Group 3. In such case, if later on changes need to be introduced in the \ndetailed scope of work detailed in the CAME to include new aircraft types (within Group 3), this may \nbe done by the procedure referred to in point CAMO.A.130(c). \nSpecial case for ELA1 aircraft: \nIn order to promote standardisation, for this category of aircraft the following approach is \nrecommended: \n− Possible ratings to be endorsed in EASA Form 14: \n− ELA1 sailplanes; \n− ELA1 powered sailplanes and ELA1 aeroplanes; \n− ELA1 balloons; \n− ELA1 airships. \n− Before endorsing any of those ratings (for example, ELA1 sailplanes) in EASA Form 14, the \ncompetent authority should audit that the organisation is capable of managing at least one \naircraft type (for example, one type of sailplanes within the ELA1 category), including the \navailability of the necessary facilities, data, maintenance programmes, and staff. \nAMC1 CAMO.B.310(e)(2) Initial certification procedure \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) The competent authority should indicate its approval of the CAME in writing. \n(b) Contracts for subcontracting continuing airworthiness management tasks by CAMOs should be \nincluded in the continuing airworthiness organisation exposition. The competent authorities \nshould verify that the standards set forth in AMC1 CAMO.A.125(d)(3) have been met when \napproving the exposition. \n(c) The competent authority while investigating the acceptability of the proposed subcontracted \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks arrangements should take into account, in the \nsubcontracted organisation, all other such contracts that are in place irrespective of state of \nregistry in terms of sufficiency of resources, expertise, management structure, facilities and ",

The maintenance history \nrecord and acceptance test report or statement, if applicable, should be attached \nto the EASA Form 1. \n2.5. New/unused aircraft components \n2.5.1. Any unused aircraft component in storage without an EASA Form 1 up to the \neffective date(s) for Part-21 that was manufactured by an organisation acceptable \nto the competent authority at the time may be issued an EASA Form 1 by an \nappropriately rated maintenance organisation approved under M.A. Subpart F. The \nEASA Form 1 should be issued in accordance with the following subparagraphs \nwhich should be included in a procedure within the maintenance organisation \nmanual. \nNote 1: It should be understood that the release of a stored but unused aircraft \ncomponent in accordance with this paragraph represents a maintenance release \nunder M.A. Subpart F and not a production release under Part-21. It is not intended \nto bypass the production release procedure agreed by the Member State for parts \nand subassemblies intended for fitment on the manufacturers own production \nline. \n(a) An acceptance test report or statement should be available for all used and \nunused aircraft components that are subject to acceptance testing after \nmanufacturing or maintenance as appropriate. \n(b) The aircraft component should be inspected for compliance with the \nmanufacturer’s instructions and limitations for storage and condition \nincluding any requirement for limited storage life, inhibitors, controlled \nclimate and special storage containers. In addition, or in the absence of \nspecific storage instructions, the aircraft component should be inspected for \ndamage, corrosion and leakage to ensure good condition. \n(c) The storage life used of any storage life-limited parts should be established. \n2.5.2. If it is not possible to establish satisfactory compliance with all applicable \nconditions specified in subparagraph 2.5.1 (a) to (c) inclusive, the aircraft \ncomponent should be disassembled by an appropriately rated organisation and \nsubjected to a check for incorporated ADs, repairs and modifications and \ninspected/tested in accordance with the maintenance data to establish \nsatisfactory condition and, if relevant, all seals, lubricants and life-limited parts \nreplaced.

Subcontracted continuing airworthiness management tasks \n1.1. To actively control the standards of the subcontracted organisation, the CAMO should employ \na person or group of persons who are trained and competent in the disciplines associated with \nPart-CAMO. As such, they are responsible for determining what maintenance is required, when \nit has to be performed, by whom and to what standard in order to ensure the continuing \nairworthiness of the aircraft to be operated. \n1.2. The CAMO should conduct a pre-subcontract audit to establish that the organisation to be \nsubcontracted can achieve the standards required by Part-CAMO in connection with the \nactivities to be subcontracted. \n1.3. The CAMO should ensure that the organisation to be subcontracted has sufficient and qualified \npersonnel who are trained and competent in the functions to be subcontracted. In assessing \nthe adequacy of personnel resources, the CAMO should consider the particular needs of those \nactivities that are to be subcontracted, while taking into account the subcontracted \norganisations existing commitments. \n1.4. To be appropriately approved to subcontract continuing airworthiness management tasks, the \nCAMO should have procedures for the management control of these arrangements. The CAME \nshould contain relevant procedures to reflect its control of those arrangements made with the \nsubcontracted organisation. \n1.5. Subcontracted continuing airworthiness management tasks should be addressed in a contract \nbetween the CAMO and the subcontracted organisation. The contract should also specify that \nthe subcontracted organisation is responsible for informing the CAMO that is in turn responsible \nfor notifying the respective competent authority, of any subsequent changes that affect their \nability to fulfil the contract. \n1.6. The subcontracted organisation should use procedures which set out the manner of fulfilling its \nresponsibilities with regard to the subcontracted activities. Such procedures may be developed \nby either the subcontracted organisation or the CAMO. \n1.7. Where the subcontracted organisation develops its own procedures, they should be compatible \nwith the CAME and the terms of the contract. These should be accepted by the competent \nauthority as extended procedures of the CAMO and as such should be cross-referenced in the \nCAME. One current copy of the subcontracted organisation’s relevant procedures should be \nkept by the CAMO and should be accessible to the competent authority when needed. \nNote: Should any conflict arise between the subcontracted organisation’s procedures and those \nof the CAMO, then the policy and procedures of the CAME will prevail. \n1.8. The contract should also specify that the subcontracted organisation’s procedures may only be \namended with the agreement of the CAMO. The CAMO should ensure that these amendments \nare compatible with its CAME and comply with Part-CAMO. \nThe CAMO should nominate the person responsible for continued monitoring and acceptance \nof the subcontracted organisation’s procedures and their amendments. The controls used to \nfulfil this function should be clearly set out in the amendment section of the CAME detailing the \nlevel of CAMO involvement. ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM to \nANNEX Vc (Part-CAMO)  Page 1192 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n1.9. Whenever any elements of the continuing airworthiness management tasks are subcontracted, \nthe CAMO personnel should have access to all relevant data in order to fulfil their \nresponsibilities. \nNote: The CAMO retains the authority to override, whenever necessary for the continuing \nairworthiness of their aircraft, any recommendation of the subcontracted organisation. \n1.10. The CAMO should ensure that the subcontracted organisation continues to have qualified \ntechnical expertise and sufficient resources to perform the subcontracted tasks while complying \nwith the relevant procedures. Failure to do so may invalidate the CAMO approval. \n1.11. The contract should provide for competent authority monitoring. \n1.12. The contract should address the respective responsibilities to ensure that any findings arising \nfrom the competent authority monitoring will be closed to the satisfaction of the competent \nauthority. \n2. Accomplishment \nThis paragraph describes the topics which may be applicable to such subcontracting \narrangements. \n2.1. Scope of work \nThe type of aircraft and their registrations, engine types and/or components subject to the \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks contract should be specified. \n2.2. Maintenance programme development and amendment \nThe CAMO may subcontract the preparation of the draft maintenance programme and any \nsubsequent amendments. However, the CAMO remains responsible for assessing that the draft \nproposals meet its needs and for obtaining competent authority approval, where applicable; \nthe relevant procedures should specify these responsibilities. The contract should also stipulate \nthat any data necessary to substantiate the approval of the initial programme or an amendment \nto this programme should be provided for CAMO agreement and/or competent authority upon \nrequest. \n2.3. Maintenance programme effectiveness and reliability \nThe CAMO should have a system in place to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the \nmaintenance programme based on maintenance and operational experience. The collection of \ndata and initial assessment may be made by the subcontracted organisation; the required \nactions are to be endorsed by the CAMO. \nWhere reliability monitoring is used to establish the effectiveness of the maintenance \nprogramme, this may be provided by the subcontracted organisation and should be specified in \nthe relevant procedures. Reference should be made to the approved maintenance and \nreliability programme. Participation of the CAMO’s personnel in reliability meetings with the \nsubcontracted organisation should also be specified. \nWhen providing reliability data, the subcontracted organisation is limited to working with \nprimary data/documents provided by the CAMO or data provided by the CAMO’s contracted \nmaintenance organisation(s) from which the reports are derived. The pooling of reliability data \nis permitted if it is acceptable to the competent authority. \n2.4. Permitted variations to the maintenance programme \nThe reasons and justification for any proposed variation to scheduled maintenance may be \nprepared by the subcontracted organisation. Acceptance of the proposed variation should be ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM to \nANNEX Vc (Part-CAMO)  Page 1193 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ngranted by the CAMO. The means by which the CAMO acceptance is given should be specified \nin the relevant procedures. When outside the limits set out in the maintenance programme, the \nCAMO is required to obtain approval by the competent authority. \n2.5. Scheduled maintenance \nWhere the subcontracted organisation plans and defines maintenance checks or inspections in \naccordance with the approved maintenance programme, the required liaison with the CAMO, \nincluding feedback, should be defined. \nThe planning control and documentation should be specified in the appropriate supporting \nprocedures. These procedures should typically set out the CAMO’s level of involvement in each \ntype of check. This will normally involve the CAMO assessing and agreeing to a work \nspecification on a case-by-case basis for base maintenance checks. For routine line maintenance \nchecks, this may be controlled on a day-to-day basis by the subcontracted organisation subject \nto appropriate liaison and CAMO controls to ensure timely compliance. This may typically \ninclude but is not necessarily limited to: \n− applicable work package, including work cards; \n− scheduled component removal list; \n− ADs to be incorporated; \n− modifications to be incorporated. \nThe associated procedures should ensure that the CAMO is informed in a timely manner of the \naccomplishment of such tasks. \n2.6. Compliance monitoring and risk assessment \nThe CAMO’s management system should monitor the adequacy of the subcontracted \ncontinuing airworthiness management task performance for compliance with the contract and \nwith Part-CAMO and assess the risks entailed by such subcontracting. The terms of the contract \nshould therefore include a provision allowing the CAMO to perform a surveillance (including \naudits and assessments) of the subcontracted organisation. The aim of the surveillance is \nprimarily to investigate and judge the effectiveness of those subcontracted activities and \nthereby to ensure compliance with Part-CAMO and the contract and mitigate related safety \nrisks. Audit and assessment reports may be subject to review when requested by the competent \nauthority. \n2.7. Access to the competent authority \nThe contract should specify that the subcontracted organisation should always grant access to \nthe competent authority. \n2.8. Maintenance data \nThe maintenance data used for the purpose of the contract should be specified, together with \nthose responsible for providing such documentation and the competent authority responsible \nfor the acceptance/approval of such data, when applicable. The CAMO should ensure that such \ndata, including revisions, is readily available to the CAMO personnel and to those in the \nsubcontracted organisation who may be required to assess such data. The CAMO should \nestablish a ‘fast-track’ means to ensure that urgent data is transmitted to the subcontractor in \na timely manner. Maintenance data is defined in M.A.401(b) or ML.A.401(b). \n2.9. Airworthiness directives (ADs) ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM to \nANNEX Vc (Part-CAMO)  Page 1194 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nWhile the various aspects of AD assessment, planning and follow-up may be accomplished by \nthe subcontracted organisation, AD embodiment is performed by a maintenance organisation. \nThe CAMO is responsible for ensuring timely embodiment of the applicable ADs and is to be \nprovided with notification of compliance. It, therefore, follows that the CAMO should have clear \npolicies and procedures on AD embodiment supported by defined procedures which will ensure \nthat the CAMO agrees to the proposed means of compliance. \nThe relevant procedures should specify: \n− what information (e.g. AD publications, continuing airworthiness records, flight \nhours/cycles, etc.) the subcontracted organisation needs from the CAMO; \n− what information (e.g. AD planning listing, detailed engineering order, etc.) the CAMO \nneeds from the subcontracted organisation in order to ensure timely compliance with the \nADs. \nTo fulfil the above responsibility, the CAMO should ensure that it receives current mandatory \ncontinued airworthiness information for the aircraft and equipment it is managing. \n2.10. Service bulletin (SB) modifications \nThe subcontracted organisation may be required to review and make recommendations on the \nembodiment of an SB and other associated non-mandatory material based on a clear policy \nestablished by the CAMO. This should be specified in the contract. \n2.11. Mandatory life limitation or scheduled maintenance controls and component control/removal \nforecast \nWhere the subcontracted organisation performs planning activities, it should be specified that \nthe organisation should receive the current flight cycles, flight hours, landings and/or calendar \ncontrolled details, as applicable, at a frequency to be specified in the contract. The frequency \nshould be such that it allows the organisation to properly perform the subcontracted planning \nfunctions. It, therefore, follows that there will need to be adequate liaison between the CAMO, \nthe contracted maintenance organisation(s) and the subcontracted organisation. Additionally, \nthe contract should specify how the CAMO will be in possession of all current flight cycles, flight \nhours, etc., so that it may assure the timely accomplishment of the required maintenance. \n2.12. Engine health monitoring \nIf the CAMO subcontracts the on-wing engine health monitoring, the subcontracted \norganisation should receive all the relevant information to perform this task, including any \nparameter reading deemed necessary to be supplied by the CAMO for this control. The contract \nshould also specify what kind of feedback information (such as engine limitation, appropriate \ntechnical advice, etc.) the organisation should provide to the CAMO. \n2.13. Defect control \nWhere the CAMO has subcontracted the day-to-day control of technical log deferred defects, \nthis should be specified in the contract and should be adequately described in the appropriate \nprocedures. The operator’s minimum equipment list (MEL)/configuration deviation list (CDL) \nprovides the basis for establishing which defects may be deferred and the associated limits. The \nprocedures should also define the responsibilities and actions to be taken for defects such as \naircraft on ground (AOG) situations, repetitive defects, and damage beyond the limits \nestablished by the type certificate holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance. \nFor all other defects identified during maintenance, the information should be brought to the \nattention of the CAMO which, depending upon the procedural authority granted by the ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM to \nANNEX Vc (Part-CAMO)  Page 1195 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ncompetent authority, may determine that some defects can be deferred. Therefore, adequate \nliaison between the CAMO, its subcontracted organisation and contracted maintenance \norganisation should be ensured. \nThe subcontracted organisation should make a positive assessment of potential deferred \ndefects and consider the potential hazards arising from the cumulative effect of any \ncombination of defects. The subcontracted organisations should liaise with the CAMO to get its \nagreement following this assessment. \nDeferment of MEL/CDL allowable defects can be accomplished by a contracted maintenance \norganisation in compliance with the relevant technical log procedures, subject to the \nacceptance by the aircraft commander. \n2.14. Occurrence reporting \nAll incidents and safety occurrences should be collected, and those that meet the reporting \ncriteria should be reported as required by point CAMO.A.160 in accordance with a procedure \nestablished by the CAMO (see GM1 CAMO.A.205). \n2.15. Continuing airworthiness records \nThey may be maintained and kept by the subcontracted organisation on behalf of the CAMO, \nwhich remains the owner of these documents. However, the CAMO should be provided with \nthe current status of AD compliance and life-limited parts and time-controlled components in \naccordance with the agreed procedures. The CAMO should also be granted unrestricted and \ntimely access to the original records as and when needed. Online access to the appropriate \ninformation systems is acceptable. \nThe record-keeping requirements of point CAMO.A.220 should be met. Access to the records \nby duly authorised members of the competent authority should be granted upon request. \n2.16. Maintenance check flight (MCF) procedures \nMCFs are performed under the control of the operator in coordination with the CAMO. MCF \nrequirements from the subcontracted organisation or contracted maintenance organisation \nshould be agreed by the operator/CAMO. \n2.17. Communication between the CAMO and the subcontracted organisation \n2.17.1. In order to fulfil its airworthiness responsibility, the CAMO needs to receive all the \nrelevant reports and relevant maintenance data. The contract should specify what \ninformation should be provided and when. \n2.17.2. Meetings provide one important cornerstone whereby the CAMO can fulfil part of its \nresponsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of the operated aircraft. They should be used \nto establish good communication between the CAMO, the subcontracted organisation \nand the contracted maintenance organisation. The terms of the contract should include, \nwhenever appropriate, the provision for a certain number of meetings to be held \nbetween the involved parties. Details of the types of liaison meetings and associated \nterms of reference of each meeting should be documented. The meetings may include \nbut are not limited to all or a combination of: \n(a) Contract review \nBefore the contract is enforced, it is very important that the technical personnel of \nboth parties, that are involved in the fulfilment of the contract, meet in order to \nbe sure that every point leads to a common understanding of the duties of both \nparties.

Maintenance contracts \nThe following paragraphs are not intended to provide a standard maintenance contract, but to \nprovide a list of the main points that should be addressed, when applicable, in a maintenance \ncontract between the CAMO and the maintenance organisation. The following paragraphs only \naddress technical matters and exclude matters such as costs, delay, warranty, etc. \nWhen maintenance is contracted to more than one maintenance organisation (for example, \naircraft base maintenance to X, engine maintenance to Y, and line maintenance to Z1, Z2 and \nZ3), attention should be paid to the consistency of the different maintenance contracts. \nA maintenance contract is not normally intended to provide appropriate detailed work \ninstructions to personnel. Accordingly, there should be established organisational roles and \nresponsibilities, procedures and routines in the CAMO and the maintenance organisation to \ncover these functions in a satisfactory way such that any person involved is informed about \nhis/her accountabilities, responsibilities and the procedures that apply. These procedures and \nroutines can be included/appended to the CAME and to the maintenance organisation’s \nmanual/maintenance organisation exposition (MOE), or can consist in separate procedures. In \nother words, procedures and routines should reflect the conditions of the contract. \n2. Aircraft/engine maintenance \nThe following subparagraphs may be adapted to a maintenance contract that applies to aircraft \nbase maintenance, aircraft line maintenance, and engine maintenance. \nAircraft maintenance also includes the maintenance of the engines and auxiliary power units \n(APU) while they are installed on the aircraft. \n2.1. Scope of work \nThe type of maintenance to be performed by the maintenance organisation should be specified \nunambiguously. In case of line and/or base maintenance, the contract should specify the aircraft \ntype and, preferably, should include the aircraft’s registrations. \nIn case of engine maintenance, the contract should specify the engine type. \n2.2. Locations identified for the performance of maintenance/certificates held \nThe place(s) where base, line or engine maintenance, as applicable, will be performed should \nbe specified. The certificate held by the maintenance organisation at the place(s) where \nmaintenance will be performed should be referred to in the contract. If necessary, the contract \nmay address the possibility of performing maintenance at any location subject to the need for \nsuch maintenance arising either from the unserviceability of the aircraft or from the necessity \nto support occasional line maintenance. \n2.3. Subcontracting \nThe maintenance contract should specify under which conditions the maintenance organisation \nmay subcontract tasks to a third party (regardless if this third party is approved or not). At least, \nthe contract should make reference to M.A.615, CAO.A.095(a)(2) and 145.A.75(b). Additional \nguidance is provided by the associated AMC and GM. In addition, the CAMO may require the \nmaintenance organisation to obtain the CAMO approval before subcontracting to a third party. \nAccess should be given to the CAMO to any information (especially the compliance monitoring \ninformation) about the maintenance organisation’s subcontractors involved in the contract. It \nshould, however, be noted that under the CAMO responsibility both the CAMO and its ",
    " \nAnnex Vc (Part-CAMO) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM to \nANNEX Vc (Part-CAMO)  Page 1199 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ncompetent authority are entitled to be fully informed about subcontracting, although the \ncompetent authority will normally only be concerned with aircraft, engine and APU \nsubcontracting. \n2.4. Maintenance programme \nThe maintenance programme, under which maintenance has to be performed, has to be \nspecified. \nThe CAMO should have that maintenance programme approved by its competent authority. \n2.5. Monitoring \nThe terms of the contract should include a provision allowing the organisation to monitor the \nmaintenance organisation in terms of compliance with the applicable requirements. The \nmaintenance contract should specify how the results of such monitoring are taken into account \nby the maintenance organisation (See also paragraph 2.23. ‘Meetings’). \n2.6. Competent authority involvement \nThe contract should identify the competent authority(ies) responsible for the oversight of the \naircraft, the operator, the CAMO, and the maintenance organisation. Additionally, the contract \nshould allow competent authority(ies) access to the maintenance organisation. \n2.7. Maintenance data \nThe contract should specify the maintenance data and any other manual required for the \nfulfilment of the contract, and how these data and manuals are made available and kept current \n(regardless if they are provided by the CAMO or by the maintenance organisation). \nThis may include but is not limited to: \n− maintenance programme, \n− airworthiness directives, \n− repairs/modification data, \n− aircraft maintenance manual, \n− aircraft illustrated parts catalogue (IPC), \n− wiring diagrams, \n− troubleshooting manual, \n− MEL (normally on board the aircraft), \n− operator’s manual, \n− flight manual, \n− engine maintenance manual, \n− engine overhaul manual. \n2.8. Incoming conditions \nThe contract should specify in which condition the aircraft should be made available to the \nmaintenance organisation.

Under no \ncircumstances may an EASA Form 1 be issued in accordance with this \nparagraph 2.6 if it is suspected that the aircraft component has been \nsubjected to extremes of stress, temperatures or immersion which could \naffect its operation. \n(e) A maintenance history record should be available for all used serialised \naircraft components. \n(f) Compliance with known modifications and repairs should be established. \n(g) The flight hours/cycles/landings as applicable of any life-limited parts and \ntime-controlled components including time since overhaul should be \nestablished. \n(h) Compliance with known applicable airworthiness directives should be \nestablished. \n(i) Subject to satisfactory compliance with this subparagraph 2.6.1, an EASA \nForm 1 may be issued and should contain the information as specified in \nparagraph 2.4 including the aircraft from which the aircraft component was \nremoved. \n2.6.2. Serviceable aircraft components removed from a non-Member State registered \naircraft may only be issued an EASA Form 1 if the components are leased or loaned \nfrom the maintenance organisation approved under M.A. Subpart F who retains \ncontrol of the airworthiness status of the components. An EASA Form 1 may be \nissued and should contain the information as specified in paragraph 2.4 including \nthe aircraft from which the aircraft component was removed. \n2.7. Used aircraft components removed from an aircraft withdrawn from service. Serviceable \naircraft components removed from a Member State registered aircraft withdrawn from \nservice may be issued an EASA Form 1 by a maintenance organisation approved under \nM.A. Subpart F subject to compliance with this subparagraph. \n(a) Aircraft withdrawn from service are sometimes dismantled for spares. This is \nconsidered to be a maintenance activity and should be accomplished under the \ncontrol of an organisation approved under M.A. Subpart F, employing procedures \napproved by the competent authority. \n(b) To be eligible for installation, components removed from such aircraft may be \nissued with an EASA Form 1 by an appropriately rated organisation following a \nsatisfactory assessment. \n(c) As a minimum, the assessment will need to satisfy the standards set out in \nparagraphs 2.5 and 2.6 as appropriate. This should, where known, include the \npossible need for the alignment of scheduled maintenance that may be necessary \nto comply with the maintenance programme applicable to the aircraft on which \nthe component is to be installed.

Components found to be unserviceable \nare to be identified as such and quarantined pending a decision on the actions to \nbe taken. Records of the maintenance accomplished to establish serviceability are \nto form part of the component maintenance history. \n(h) Suitable M.A. Subpart F facilities for the removal and storage of removed \ncomponents are to be used which include suitable environmental conditions, \nlighting, access equipment, aircraft tooling and storage facilities for the work to be \nundertaken. While it may be acceptable for components to be removed, given local \nenvironmental conditions, without the benefit of an enclosed facility subsequent \ndisassembly (if required) and storage of the components should be in accordance \nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations. \n2.8. Used aircraft components maintained by organisations not approved in accordance with \nM.A Subpart F, Part-145 or Part-CAO. \nFor used components maintained by a maintenance organisation not approved under \nPart-M Subpart F or Part-145, due care should be taken before acceptance of such \ncomponents. In such cases an appropriately rated maintenance organisation approved \nunder M.A. Subpart F should establish satisfactory conditions by: \n(a) dismantling the component for sufficient inspection in accordance with the \nappropriate maintenance data, \n(b) replacing of all life-limited parts and time-controlled components when no \nsatisfactory evidence of life used is available and/or the components are in an \nunsatisfactory condition, \n(c) reassembling and testing as necessary the component, \n(d) completing all certification requirements as specified in M.A.613. \nIn the case of used components maintained by an FAA Part-145 repair station (USA) or by \nTCCA CAR573 approved maintenance organisations (Canada) that does not hold an EASA \nPart-145 or M.A. Subpart F approval, the conditions (a) through (d) described above may \nbe replaced by the following conditions: \n(a) availability of an 8130-3 (FAA) or TCCA 24-0078 (TCCA) or an Authorized Release \nCertificate Form One (TCCA), ",

Depending on the \nscope of work, other facilities are acceptable as long as protection is ensured from \ninclement weather and contamination. This may include, for example, working in the field \nor in non-aviation premises (closed or not). \n(2) These facilities do not need to be individually approved by the competent authority as \nlong as the CAE describes for each type of facility the scope of work, the tooling and \nequipment available, and the permitted environmental conditions (weather, \ncontamination). \n(3) The organisation should include, as part of the quality system/organisational review, a \nsampling of the compliance with these conditions during certain maintenance events. \n(g) It is acceptable to combine any or all of the office accommodation requirements into one office \nsubject to the staff having sufficient room to carry out the assigned tasks. \n(h) Storage facilities for serviceable aircraft components should be clean, well ventilated and \nmaintained at an even dry temperature to minimise the effects of condensation. The \nmanufacturer’s storage recommendations should be followed for those aircraft components \nidentified in such published recommendations. \n(i) Adequate storage racks should be provided and strong enough to hold aircraft components and \nprovide sufficient support for large aircraft components such that the component is not \ndamaged during storage. \n(j) All aircraft components, wherever practicable, should remain packaged in their protective \nmaterial to minimise damage and corrosion during storage. A shelf life control system should \nbe utilised and identity tags used to identify components. \n(k) ‘Segregation' refers to storing unserviceable components in a separate secured location from \nserviceable components. \n(l) Segregation and management of any unserviceable component should be ensured according to \nthe pertinent procedure approved to that organisation. \n(m) Procedures should be defined by the organisation describing the decision process for the status \nof unserviceable components. This procedure should identify at least the following: \n(1) role and responsibilities of the persons managing the decision process; \n(2) description of the decision process to choose between maintaining, storing or mutilating \na component; and \n(3) traceability of decision. \n(n) Once unserviceable components or materials have been identified as unsalvageable in \naccordance with M.A.501(a)(3) or ML.A.504(c), the organisation should establish secure areas \nin which to segregate such items and to prevent unauthorised access. Unsalvageable \ncomponents should be managed through a procedure to ensure that these components receive \nthe appropriate final disposal according to M.A.504(b) or ML.A.504(d) or (e).

This training and experience could be demonstrated, for example, by: \n(i) holding a Part-66 licence in the same subcategory as the licence subcategory or \nequivalent necessary to release or sign off the critical maintenance task; or \n(ii) holding a Part-66 licence in the same category and specific training in the task to be \ninspected; or \n(iii) having received appropriate training and having gained relevant experience in the \nspecific task to be inspected. \n(c) How to perform an independent inspection \nThe independent inspection should ensure, for example, the correct assembly, locking and \nsense of operation of the parts involved. When inspecting control systems that have undergone \nmaintenance, the ‘independent qualified person’ should consider the following points \nindependently: \n(1) all those parts of the system that have actually been disconnected or disturbed should be \ninspected for their correct assembly and locking; \n(2) the system as a whole should be inspected for full and free movement over the complete \nrange; \n(3) cables should be tensioned correctly with adequate clearance at secondary stops; \n(4) the operation of the control system as a whole should be observed to ensure that the \ncontrols operate in the correct sense; \n(5) if different control systems are interconnected so that they affect each other, all the \ninteractions should be checked through the full range of the applicable controls; and \n(6) software that is part of the critical maintenance task should be checked; for example, its \nversion and its compatibility with the aircraft configuration. \n(d) What to do in unforeseen cases when only one person is available \nREINSPECTION \n(1) Reinspection is subject to the same conditions as the independent inspection is, except \nthat the ‘authorised person’ performing the maintenance task is also acting as \n‘independent qualified person’ and performs the inspection. \n(2) For critical maintenance tasks, reinspection should only be used in unforeseen \ncircumstances when only one person is available to carry out the task and perform the \nindependent inspection.

Properly executed and retained records provide owners, operators and maintenance personnel \nwith information essential in controlling unscheduled and scheduled maintenance, and \ntroubleshooting to eliminate the need for re-inspection and rework to establish airworthiness. \n2. The prime objective is to have secure and easily retrievable records with comprehensive and \nlegible contents. The aircraft record should contain basic details of all serialised aircraft \ncomponents and all other significant aircraft components installed, to ensure traceability to \nsuch installed aircraft component documentation, associated maintenance data and data for \nmodifications and repairs. \n3. The maintenance record can be either a paper or computer system or any combination of both. \nThe records should remain legible throughout the required retention period. \n4. Paper systems should use robust material which can withstand normal handling and filing. \n5. Computer systems may be used to control maintenance and/or record details of maintenance \nwork carried out. Computer systems used for maintenance should have at least one backup \nsystem which should be updated at least within 24 hours of any maintenance. Each terminal is \nrequired to contain programme safeguards against the ability of unauthorised personnel to \nalter the database. \nAMC M.A.614(c) Maintenance and airworthiness review records \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nAssociated maintenance data is specific information such as repair and modification data.

This means that \nthe certificate will show the boxes ‘maintenance’ and ‘airworthiness reviews’ ticked. \nAMC1 CAO.A.095(b)(3) Privileges of the organisation \nED Decision 2021/009/R \nSUBCONTRACTING OF CONTINUING AIRWORTHINESS TASKS \n(a) The CAO may subcontract certain continuing airworthiness management tasks to qualified \norganisations. The subcontracted organisation performs the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement tasks as an integral part of the CAO quality system, irrespective of any other \napproval held by the subcontracted organisation (including CAMO, CAO or Part-145 approval). \n(b) The CAO remains accountable for the satisfactory completion of the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement tasks irrespective of any contract that may be established. \n(c) In order to fulfil this responsibility, the CAO should be satisfied that the actions taken by the \nsubcontracted organisation meet the standards required by Part-CAO. Therefore, the CAO \nmanagement of such activities should be accomplished by: \n(1) active control through direct involvement; and/or \n(2) endorsing the recommendations made by the subcontracted organisation. \n(d) In order to retain ultimate responsibility, the CAO should limit subcontracted tasks to the \nactivities specified below: \n(1) airworthiness directive analysis and planning; \n(2) service bulletin analysis; \n(3) planning of maintenance; \n(4) reliability monitoring, engine health monitoring; \n(5) maintenance programme development and amendments; and \n(6) any other activities, which do not limit the CAO responsibilities, as agreed by the \ncompetent authority. \n(e) The CAO’s controls associated with subcontracted continuing airworthiness management tasks \nshould be reflected in the associated contract and be in accordance with the CAO policy and \nprocedures defined in the CAE. When such tasks are subcontracted, the quality system is \nconsidered to be extended to the subcontracted organisations. \n(f) With the exception of engines and auxiliary power units, contracts would normally be limited \nto one organisation per aircraft type for any combination of the subcontracted activities. Where \ncontracts are made with more than one organisation, the CAO should demonstrate that \nadequate coordination controls are in place and that the individuals’ responsibilities are clearly \ndefined in the related contracts. \n(g) Contracts should not authorise the subcontracted organisation to subcontract elements of the \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks to other organisations.

The CAO should \nonly subcontract to organisations which are specified by the competent authority on EASA \nForm 3-CAO (page 2, block titled ‘List of organisation(s) working under a quality system’). \n(i) The subcontracted organisation should agree to notify the CAO of any changes affecting the \ncontract as soon as practical. The CAO should then inform its competent authority. Failure to \ndo so may invalidate the competent authority’s acceptance of the contract. \n(j) Appendix II to AMC1 CAMO.A.125(d)(3) provides information on the subcontracting of \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks by the CAMO.

It \nshould address who is required to rectify each non-compliance and the procedure to be \nfollowed if rectification is not completed within appropriate timescales. The procedure should \nenable the accountable manager to be kept informed of any safety issues and the extent of \ncompliance with Part-CAO. \n(b) The audit reports referenced in AMC1 CAO.A.100(b) should be sent to the relevant department \nfor rectification action giving target rectification dates. Rectification dates should be discussed \nwith such department before the quality department or nominated auditor confirms such dates \nin the report. The relevant department is required to rectify findings and inform the quality \nmanager or the auditor of such rectification. \n(c) The accountable manager should hold regular meetings with staff to check the progress of any \ncorrective actions. If these meetings are delegated to the quality manager on a day-to-day basis, \nthen the accountable manager should: \n(1) meet the senior staff involved at least twice per year to review the overall performance \nof the compliance monitoring function; and \n(2) receive at least a half-yearly summary report on non-compliance findings. \nAMC1 CAO.A.100(b) Quality system and organisational review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nQUALITY SYSTEM — INDEPENDENT AUDIT \n(a) An essential element of the quality system is the independent audit. \n(b) The independent audit should be an objective process of routine sample checks of all aspects \nof the organisation’s ability to carry out continuing airworthiness management and/or \nmaintenance to the standards required by Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. It should include \nsome product sampling (e.g. product audit) as this is the end result of the process. \n(c) The independent audit should provide an objective overview of the complete set of continuing- \nairworthiness-management- and/or maintenance-related activities. \n(d) The organisation should establish an audit plan to show when and how often the activities as \nrequired by Part-M, Part-ML and Part-CAO will be audited. \n(e) The audit plan should ensure that all aspects of Part-CAO compliance are verified every year, \nincluding all the subcontracted activities, and the auditing may be carried out as a complete \nsingle exercise or (sub)divided over the annual period. The independent audit should not \nrequire each procedure to be verified against each product line when it can be shown that the \nparticular procedure is common to more than one product line and the procedure has been \nverified every year without resultant findings. Where findings have been identified, the \nparticular procedure should be verified against other product lines until the findings have been \nrectified, after which the independent audit procedure may revert to a 1-year interval for the \nparticular procedure. \n(f) Provided that there are no safety-related findings, the audit planning cycle specified in this AMC \nmay be increased by up to 100 %, subject to agreement by the competent authority.

It is therefore essential that \nthe approval class(es) and rating(s) and the organisations scope of work are matching. \n(b) An aircraft rating, in relation to the maintenance privileges, means that the CAO may carry out \nmaintenance on the aircraft and any component (including engines), in accordance with aircraft \nmaintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, in accordance with component \nmaintenance data, only whilst such components are fitted to the aircraft. Nevertheless, such \naircraft-rated CAO may temporarily remove a component for maintenance in order to improve \naccess to that component except when such removal creates the need for additional \nmaintenance not eligible for the requirements of point (b). This will be subject to a control \nprocedure in the CAE to be approved by the competent authority. \n(c) An engine rating (turbine, piston or electrical) means that the CAO may carry out maintenance \non the uninstalled engine and engine components, in accordance with engine maintenance data \nor, if agreed by the competent authority, in accordance with component maintenance data, \nonly whilst such components are fitted to the engine. Nevertheless, such engine-rated CAO may \ntemporarily remove a component for maintenance in order to improve access to that \ncomponent except when such removal creates the need for additional maintenance not eligible \nfor the requirements of point (c). An engine-rated CAO may also carry out maintenance on an \ninstalled engine during base and line maintenance subject to a control procedure in the CAE to \nbe approved by the competent authority. \n(d) A component rating (other-than-complete engines) means that the CAO may carry out \nmaintenance on uninstalled components (excluding complete engines) intended for fitment to \nthe aircraft or engine. This CAO may also carry out maintenance on an installed component \n(other-than-complete engines) during base and line maintenance or at an engine maintenance \nfacility subject to a control procedure in the CAE to be approved by the competent authority. \n(e) An non-destructive testing (NDT) rating is a self-contained rating not necessarily related to a \nspecific aircraft, engine or other component. The NDT rating is only necessary for a CAO that \ncarries out NDT as a particular task for another organisation. A CAO approved with an aircraft, \nengine or component rating may carry out NDT on products they are maintaining subject to the \nCAE containing NDT procedures, without the need for an NDT rating.

They should also have knowledge of audits, acquired through training or through \nexperience (preferably as an auditor, but also possibly because they actively participated in \nseveral audits conducted by the competent authority). \n(c) Elaboration of the organisational review programme \n(1) Checklist(s) covering all items necessary to be satisfied that the organisation delivers a \nsafe product and complies with the regulation. All procedures described in the CAE should \nbe addressed. \n(2) A schedule for the accomplishment of the checklist items. Each item should be checked \nat least every 12 months. The organisation may choose to conduct one full review \nannually or to conduct several partial reviews. \n(d) Performance of organisational reviews \nEach checklist item should be answered using an appropriate combination of: \n− review of records, documentation, etc.; \n− sample check of aircraft under contract or being maintained under a work order; \n− interview of personnel involved; \n− review of discrepancies and internal reports (e.g. notified difficulties when using current \nprocedures and tools, systematic deviations from procedures, etc.); \n− review of complaints filed by customers. \n(e) Management of findings and occurrence reports \nAll findings should be recorded and notified to the affected persons. \n(1) All findings that lower the safety standard and seriously hazard flight safety should be \nimmediately notified to the competent authority and all necessary actions on aircraft in \nservice should be immediately taken. \n(2) All occurrence reports should be reviewed with the aim of continuous improvement of \nthe system by identifying possible corrective and preventive actions. This should be done \nin order to find prior indicators (e.g. notified difficulties when using current procedures ",

Scope of work \n− Check that all aircraft under contract are covered in EASA Form 3-CAO. \n− Check that the scope of work in the CAE is consistent with EASA Form 3-CAO. \n− Check that no work has been performed outside the scope of EASA Form 3-CAO and the \nCAE. \n− Is it justified to retain in the approved scope of work aircraft types for which the \norganisation has no longer aircraft under contract? \n2. Maintenance data \n− Check that the maintenance data is present and up to date for the ongoing maintenance \nactivity. \n− Check that no change has been made to the maintenance data from the design approval \nholder (DAH) or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance without the DAH or \ndeclarant being notified. \n3. Equipment and tools \n− Check the availability of maintenance equipment and tools against the lists in the CAE \nand check if they are still appropriate with regard to the maintenance data. \n− Check tools for proper calibration (sample check). \n4. Stores \n− Do the stores meet the criteria of the CAE procedures? \n− Check by sampling some items in the store for presence of proper documentation and \nany overdue items. \n5. Certification of maintenance \n− Has maintenance on products and components been properly certified? \n− Have implementations of modifications/repairs been carried out with appropriate \napproval of such modifications/repairs (sample check)? \n6.

The person or group of persons should represent the continuing airworthiness management \nstructure of the organisation and be responsible for all continuing airworthiness functions. \nDependent on the size of the operation and the organisational set-up, the continuing \nairworthiness functions may be divided under individual managers or combined in nearly any \nnumber of ways. However, if a quality system is in place it should be independent from the \nother functions. \n2. The actual number of persons to be employed and their necessary qualifications is dependent \nupon the tasks to be performed and thus dependent on the size and complexity of the \norganisation (general aviation aircraft, corporate aircraft, number of aircraft and the aircraft \ntypes, complexity of the aircraft and their age and for commercial air transport, route network, \nline or charter, ETOPS) and the amount and complexity of maintenance contracting. \nConsequently, the number of persons needed, and their qualifications may differ greatly from \none organisation to another and a simple formula covering the whole range of possibilities is \nnot feasible. \n3. To enable the competent authority to accept the number of persons and their qualifications, an \norganisation should make an analysis of the tasks to be performed, the way in which it intends \nto divide and/or combine these tasks, indicate how it intends to assign responsibilities and \nestablish the number of man/hours and the qualifications needed to perform the tasks. With ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 134 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nsignificant changes in the aspects relevant to the number and qualifications of persons needed, \nthis analysis should be updated. \n4. Nominated person or group of persons should have: \n4.1. practical experience and expertise in the application of aviation safety standards and safe \noperating practices; \n4.2. a comprehensive knowledge of: \n(a) relevant parts of operational requirements and procedures; \n(b) the AOC holder's operations specifications when applicable; \n(c) the need for, and content of, the relevant parts of the AOC holder's operations \nmanual when applicable; \n4.3. knowledge of quality systems; \n4.4. five years relevant work experience of which at least two years should be from the \naeronautical industry in an appropriate position; \n4.5. a relevant engineering degree or an aircraft maintenance technician qualification with \nadditional education acceptable to the competent authority. ‘relevant engineering \ndegree’ means an engineering degree from aeronautical, mechanical, electrical, \nelectronic, avionic or other studies relevant to the maintenance and continuing \nairworthiness of aircraft/aircraft components; \nThe above recommendation may be replaced by 5 years of experience additional to those \nalready recommended by paragraph 4.4 above. These 5 years should cover an \nappropriate combination of experience in tasks related to aircraft maintenance and/or \ncontinuing airworthiness management and/or surveillance of such tasks; \n4.6. thorough knowledge with the organisation's continuing airworthiness management \nexposition; \n4.7. knowledge of a relevant sample of the type(s) of aircraft gained through a formalised \ntraining course. These courses should be at least at a level equivalent to Part-66 Appendix \nIII Level 1 General Familiarisation and could be imparted by a Part-147 organisation, by \nthe manufacturer, or by any other organisation accepted by the competent authority. \n‘Relevant sample’ means that these courses should cover typical systems embodied in \nthose aircraft being within the scope of approval. \nFor all balloons and any other aircraft of 2 730 kg MTOM and below the formalised \ntraining courses may be replaced by demonstration of knowledge. This knowledge may \nbe demonstrated by documented evidence or by an assessment performed by the \ncompetent authority. This assessment should be recorded. \n4.8. knowledge of maintenance methods. \n4.9. knowledge of applicable regulations. ",

In case of complex motor-powered aircraft, aircraft used for CAT operations, aircraft used for \ncommercial specialised operations and aircraft used by commercial ATO, the provisions of \nM.A.201 establish that a CAMO is required. This CAMO is in charge of the continuing \nairworthiness management and this includes the tasks specified in M.A.301 points (2), (3), (5) \nand (6). If the CAMO does not hold the appropriate maintenance organisation approval, then \nthe CAMO should conclude a contract with the appropriate organisation(s). \n2. The CAMO bears the responsibility for the airworthy condition of the aircraft for which it \nperforms the continuing airworthiness management. Thus, it should be satisfied before the \nintended flight that all required maintenance has been properly carried out. \n3. The CAMO should agree with the operator on the process to select a maintenance organisation \nbefore concluding any contract with a maintenance organisation. \n4. The fact that the CAMO has contracted a maintenance organisation approved under Subpart F \nor Part-145 should not prevent it from checking at the maintenance facilities on any aspect of \nthe contracted work to fulfil its responsibility for the airworthiness of the aircraft. \n5. The contract between the CAMO and the maintenance organisation(s) should specify in detail \nthe responsibilities and the work to be performed by each party. \n6. Both the specification of work and the assignment of responsibilities should be clear, \nunambiguous and sufficiently detailed to ensure that no misunderstanding arises between the \nparties concerned that could result in a situation where work that has an effect on the \nairworthiness or serviceability of aircraft is not or will not be properly performed. \n7. Special attention should be paid to procedures and responsibilities to ensure that all \nmaintenance work is performed, service bulletins are analysed and decisions are taken on their \naccomplishment, airworthiness directives are accomplished on time and that all work, including \nnon-mandatory modifications, is carried out to approved data and to the latest standards. \n8. Appendix XI to this AMC gives further details on the subject. \nAMC2 M.A.708(c) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nMAINTENANCE CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER CAMO/OPERATOR \n1. The purpose of M.A.708(c) is to ensure that all maintenance is carried out by an appropriately \napproved maintenance organisation. It is possible to contract another operator/CAMO \n(secondary operator/CAMO) that does not hold a maintenance organisation approval when it \nproves that such a contract is in the interest of the CAMO by simplifying the management of its \nmaintenance, and the CAMO keeps an appropriate control of it. In this case the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition should include appropriate procedures to ensure that all \nmaintenance is ultimately carried out on time by approved maintenance organisations in \naccordance with the CAMO’s data. In particular, the quality system procedures should place \ngreat emphasis on monitoring compliance with the above. The list of approved maintenance \norganisations, or a reference to this list, should be included in the CAMO’s continuing \nairworthiness management exposition. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 143 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n2. This contract should not preclude the CAMO from ensuring that all maintenance is performed \nby appropriately approved organisations which comply with the M.A.201 continuing \nairworthiness responsibility requirements. Typical examples of such arrangements are the \nfollowing: \n− Component maintenance: \nThe CAMO may find it more appropriate to have a primary contractor (the secondary \noperator/CAMO) dispatching the components to appropriately approved organisations \nrather than sending themselves different types of components to various maintenance \norganisations approved under Part-145. The benefit for the CAMO is that the \nmanagement of maintenance is simplified by having a single point of contact for \ncomponent maintenance. The CAMO remains responsible for ensuring that all \nmaintenance is performed by maintenance organisations approved under Part-145 and \nin accordance with the approved standards. \n− Aircraft, engine and component maintenance: \nThe CAMO may wish to have a maintenance contract with a secondary operator/CAMO \nnot approved under Part-145 for the same type of aircraft. A typical case is that of a dry- \nleased aeroplane between operators where the parties, for consistency or continuity \nreasons (especially for short-term lease agreements), find it appropriate to keep the \naeroplane under the current maintenance arrangement. Where this arrangement \ninvolves various Part-145 approved contractors, it might be more manageable for the \nlessee CAMO to have a single maintenance contract with the lessor operator/CAMO. \nWhatever type of acceptable maintenance contract is concluded, the CAMO is required \nto exercise the same level of control on contracted maintenance, particularly through the \nM.A.706(c) continuing airworthiness management group of persons and quality system \nas referred to in M.A.712. \nGM M.A.708(c) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nFor line maintenance, the actual layout of the IATA Standard Ground Handling Agreement may be \nused as a basis, but this does not preclude the CAMO from ensuring that the content of the contract \nis acceptable and especially that the contract allows the CAMO to properly exercise its maintenance \nresponsibility. Those parts of the contract that have no effect on the technical or operational aspects \nof airworthiness are outside the scope of this paragraph. \nAMC M.A.708(d) Continuing airworthiness management \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nThe intent of this paragraph is that maintenance contracts are not necessary when the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition specifies that the relevant maintenance activity may be \nordered through one-time work orders. This includes unscheduled line maintenance and may also \ninclude component maintenance up to engines, as long as the maintenance is manageable through \nwork orders, both in terms of volume and complexity. It should be noted that this paragraph implies \nthat even where base maintenance is ordered on a case-by-case basis, there should be a written \nmaintenance contract. ",

That data may be provided by the \nowner or the operator, subject to an appropriate contract being established with such an owner \nor operator. In such case, the continuing airworthiness management organisation only needs \nto keep such data for the duration of the contract, except when required by point M.A.714 of \nthis Annex (Part-M). \n(b) For aircraft not used by licenced air carriers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, \nthe approved continuing airworthiness management organisation may develop ‘baseline’ or \n‘generic’ maintenance programmes, or both, in order to allow for the initial approval or the \nextension of the scope of an approval, without having the contracts referred to in Appendix I to \nthis Annex (Part-M) or Appendix I to Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable. Those ‘baseline’ and \n‘generic’ maintenance programmes however do not preclude the need to establish an adequate \nAircraft Maintenance Programme in compliance with point M.A.302 of this Annex (Part-M) or \nML.A.302 of Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable, in due time before exercising the privileges \nreferred to in point M.A.711 of this Annex (Part-M). \nAMC M.A.709 Documentation \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nWhen using maintenance data provided by the customer, the CAMO is responsible for ensuring that \nthis data is current. As a consequence, it should establish appropriate procedures or provisions in the \ncontract with the customer. \nThe sentence ‘…, except when required by point M.A.714’, means, in particular, the need to keep a \ncopy of the customer data which was used to perform continuing airworthiness activities during the \ncontract period. \n‘Baseline’ maintenance programme: it is a maintenance programme developed for a particular aircraft \ntype following, where applicable, the maintenance review board (MRB) report, the type certificate \nholder’s maintenance planning document (MPD), the relevant chapters of the maintenance manual \nor any other maintenance data containing information on scheduling. \n‘Generic’ maintenance programme: it is a maintenance programme developed to cover a group of \nsimilar types of aircraft. These programmes should be based on the same type of instructions as the \nbaseline maintenance programme. Examples of ‘generic’ maintenance programmes could be Cessna \n100 Series (covering Cessna 150, 172, 177, etc.). \n‘Baseline’ and ‘generic’ maintenance programmes are not applicable to a particular aircraft \nregistration mark, but to an aircraft type or group of types, and should be available to the competent \nauthority prior to the initial approval and prior to the extension of the scope of an existing organisation \napproval. The intent is that the competent authority is aware of the scope and complexity of tasks \nthat will be managed before granting an organisation approval or change of approval. \nAfter this initial approval, when an owner/operator is contracted, the baseline or generic maintenance \nprogramme, as applicable, may be used to establish the M.A.302 aircraft maintenance programme, \nincorporating the additional maintenance tasks and indicating those which are not applicable to a \nparticular aircraft registration mark. This may be achieved by adding an Annex to the baseline/generic ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 145 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nmaintenance programme for each aircraft registration, specifying which tasks are added and which \nare not applicable. This will result in an aircraft maintenance programme specific for each customer. \nHowever, this does not mean that this adaptation must be performed for each contracted aircraft \nregistration. The reason is that the customer may already have an approved aircraft maintenance \nprogramme, which in that case should be used by the continuing airworthiness management \norganisation to manage the continuing airworthiness of such aircraft. \nContinuing airworthiness management organisations may seek authorisation for indirect approval in \norder to amend the aircraft maintenance programme mentioned above in accordance with \nM.A.302(c). The indirect approval procedure should include provisions to notify to the competent \nauthority that an aircraft maintenance programme specific for a customer has been created. The \nreason is that, according to M.A.704(a)9, for aircraft not used by air carriers licensed in accordance \nwith Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, the Continuing Airworthiness Management Exposition (CAME) \nonly needs to include the reference to the baseline/generic maintenance programme. \nGM M.A.709 Documentation \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nParagraph M.A.709(a) refers to continuing airworthiness tasks referred to in M.A.708. As a \nconsequence, this covers continuing airworthiness management tasks but not airworthiness reviews. \nAirworthiness review requirements are established in M.A.710 and the requirements for the \ncorresponding record retention are contained in M.A.714. \nM.A.710 Airworthiness review \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \nWhen the organisation approved in accordance with point M.A.711(b) of this Annex (Part-M) performs \nairworthiness reviews, they shall be performed in accordance with point M.A.901 of this Annex (Part- \nM) or point ML.A.903 of Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable. \nGM M.A.710 Airworthiness review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nResponsibilities of airworthiness review staff: \nThe following is a summary of the requirements contained in M.A.710 as well as the associated AMCs \nand Appendices, in relation to the responsibilities of the airworthiness review staff: \n− Airworthiness review staff are responsible for performing both the documental and the physical \nsurvey. \n− Procedures must be established by the CAMO in order to perform the airworthiness review, \nincluding the depth of samplings (refer to Appendix V to AMC1 M.A.704, paragraphs 4.2 and \n4.3). \n− Procedures must make very clear that the final word about the depth of the inspections (both \ndocumental and physical) belongs to the airworthiness review staff, who can go beyond the \ndepth contained in the CAME if they find it necessary. At the end, it is the responsibility of the \nairworthiness review staff to be satisfied that the aircraft complies with Part-M or Part-ML, as \napplicable, and is airworthy, and the organisation must ensure that no pressure or restrictions \nare imposed on the airworthiness review staff when performing their duty. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 146 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− A compliance report must be produced by the airworthiness review staff, detailing all items \nchecked and the outcome of the review. \n− Airworthiness review staff are responsible for the items checked during the airworthiness \nreview. However, they do not take over the responsibilities of the CAMO, Part-145, DOA, POA \nor any other organisations, not being responsible for problems not detected during the \nairworthiness review or for the possibility that the approved or declared maintenance \nprogramme may not include certain recommendations from the Design Approval Holder. \nObviously, if the airworthiness review staff are not independent of the airworthiness \nmanagement process and were nominated on the basis of the option of having overall authority \non such a process, they will be responsible for the full continuing airworthiness of such aircraft. \nNevertheless, this responsibility will be a consequence of their position related to M.A.706 and \nnot of their position as airworthiness review staff (M.A.707). \n− The issuance of the airworthiness review certificate (ARC) by the airworthiness review staff only \ncertifies that the aircraft is considered airworthy in relation to the scope of the airworthiness \nreview performed and the fact that the airworthiness review staff are not aware of instances of \nnon-compliance which endanger flight safety. Furthermore, it only certifies that the aircraft is \nconsidered airworthy at the time of the review. \nIt is the responsibility of the owner or contracted CAMO to ensure that the aircraft is fully airworthy \nat any time. \nM.A.711 Privileges of the organisation \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) A continuing airworthiness management organisation approved in accordance with Section A, \nSubpart G of this Annex (Part-M) may: \n1. manage the continuing airworthiness of aircraft, except those used by licenced air \ncarriers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, as listed on the approval \ncertificate; \n2. manage the continuing airworthiness of aircraft used by licenced air carriers in \naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, when listed both on its approval \ncertificate and on its Air Operator Certificate (AOC); \n3. arrange to carry out limited continuing airworthiness tasks with any contracted \norganisation, working under its quality system, as listed on the approval certificate; \n4. extend, under the conditions set out in point M.A.901(f) of this Annex (Part-M) or \nML.A.901(c) of Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable, an airworthiness review certificate that \nhas been issued by the competent authority or by another organisation or person, as \napplicable; \n5.

Therefore, \nthe CAMO management of such activities should be accomplished: \n(a) by active control through direct involvement, and/or \n(b) by endorsing the recommendations made by the subcontracted person or organisation. \n4. In order to retain ultimate responsibility, the CAMO should limit subcontracted tasks to the \nactivities specified below: \n(a) airworthiness directive analysis and planning; \n(b) service bulletin analysis; \n(c) planning of maintenance; \n(d) reliability monitoring, engine health monitoring; \n(e) maintenance programme development and amendments; \n(f) any other activities, which do not limit the CAMO responsibilities, as agreed by the \ncompetent authority. \n5. The CAMO’s controls associated with subcontracted continuing airworthiness management \ntasks should be reflected in the associated contract and be in accordance with the CAMO policy \nand procedures defined in the continuing airworthiness management exposition. When such \ntasks are subcontracted, the continuing airworthiness management system is considered to be \nextended to the subcontracted persons or organisations. \n6. With the exception of engines and auxiliary power units, contracts would normally be limited \nto one organisation per aircraft type for any combination of the activities described in Appendix \nII. Where contracts are made with more than one organisation, the CAMO should demonstrate ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 148 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nthat adequate coordination controls are in place and that the individuals’ responsibilities are \nclearly defined in the related contracts. \n7. Contracts should not authorise the subcontracted organisation to subcontract to other \norganisations elements of the continuing airworthiness management tasks. \n8. The competent authority should exercise oversight of the subcontracted activities through the \nCAMO approval. The contracts should be acceptable to the competent authority. The CAMO \nshould only subcontract to organisations which are specified by the competent authority on \nEASA Form 14. \n9. The subcontracted organisation should agree to notify the CAMO of any changes affecting the \ncontract as soon as practical. The CAMO should then inform its competent authority. Failure to \ndo so may invalidate the competent authority’s acceptance of the contract. \n10. Appendix II to AMC M.A.711(a)(3) provides information on the subcontracting of continuing \nairworthiness management tasks. \nAMC M.A.711(b) Privileges of the organisation \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nAn organisation may be approved for the privileges of M.A.711(a) only, without the privilege to carry \nout airworthiness reviews. This can be contracted to another appropriately approved organisation. In \nsuch a case, it is not mandatory that the contracted organisation is linked to an AOC holder, being \npossible to contract an appropriately approved independent continuing airworthiness management \norganisation which is approved for the same aircraft type. \nIn order to be approved for the privileges of M.A.711(b) for a particular aircraft type, it is necessary to \nbe approved for the privileges of M.A.711(a) for that aircraft type. As a consequence, the normal \nsituation in this case is that the organisation will be performing continuing airworthiness management \ntasks and performing airworthiness reviews on every aircraft type contained in the approval \ncertificate. \nNevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the organisation needs to be currently managing an \naircraft type in order to be able to perform airworthiness reviews on that aircraft type. The \norganisation may be performing only airworthiness reviews on an aircraft type without having any \ncustomer under contract for that type. \nFurthermore, this situation should not necessarily lead to the removal of the aircraft type from the \norganisation approval. As a matter of fact, since in most cases the airworthiness review staff are not \ninvolved in continuing airworthiness management activities, it cannot be argued that these \nairworthiness review staff are going to lose their skills just because the organisation is not managing \na particular aircraft type. The important issue in relation to maintaining a particular aircraft type in the \norganisation approval is whether the organisation continuously fulfils all the Subpart G requirements \n(facilities, documentation, qualified personnel, quality system, etc.) required for initial approval. \nAMC M.A.711(c) Privileges of the organisation \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nThe sentence ‘for the particular aircraft for which the organisation is approved to issue the \nairworthiness review certificate’ contained in M.A.711(c) means that: \n− For aircraft used by air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, and \nfor aircraft above 2 730kg MTOM, the permit to fly can only be issued for aircraft which are in \na controlled environment and are managed by that CAMO. ",

Compliance monitoring shall include a feedback system to the accountable \nmanager to ensure corrective action as necessary. \n(b) The quality system shall monitor activities carried out under Section A, Subpart G of this Annex \n(Part-M). It shall at least include the following functions: \n1. monitoring that all activities carried out under Section A, Subpart G of this Annex (Part- \nM) are being performed in accordance with the approved procedures, and; \n2. monitoring that all contracted maintenance is carried out in accordance with the \ncontract, and; \n3. monitoring the continued compliance with the requirements of this Part. \n(c) The records of these activities shall be stored for at least two years. \n(d) Where the approved continuing airworthiness management organisation is approved in \naccordance with another Part, the quality system may be combined with that required by the \nother Part. \n(e) For licenced air carriers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 the M.A. Subpart G \nquality system shall be an integrated part of the operator's quality system. \n(f) In the case of a small organisation not managing the continuing airworthiness of aircraft used \nby licenced air carriers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, the quality system \nmay be replaced by regular organisational reviews subject to the approval of the competent \nauthority, except when the organisation issues airworthiness review certificates for aircraft \nabove 2730 kg MTOM other than balloons. In the case where there is no quality system, the \norganisation shall not contract continuing airworthiness management tasks to other parties. \nAMC M.A.712(a) Quality system \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1. Procedures should be held current such that they reflect best practice within the organisation. \nIt is the responsibility of all employees to report any difficulties with the procedures via their \norganisation’s internal occurrence reporting mechanisms. \n2. All procedures, and changes to the procedures, should be verified and validated before use \nwhere practicable. \n3. The feedback part of the system should address who is required to rectify any non-compliance \nin each particular case and the procedure to be followed if rectification is not completed within \nappropriate timescales. The procedure should lead to the accountable manager specified in \nM.A.706. \n4. The independent quality audit reports referenced in AMC M.A.712(b) should be sent to the \nrelevant department for rectification action giving target rectification dates. Rectification dates ",

The relevant department is required to rectify findings \nand inform the quality manager or the quality auditor of such rectification. \n5. The accountable manager should hold regular meetings with staff to check progress on \nrectification except that in the large organisations such meetings may be delegated on a day to \nday basis to the quality manager subject to the accountable manager meeting at least twice per \nyear with the senior staff involved to review the overall performance and receiving at least a \nhalf yearly summary report on findings of non-compliance. \nAMC M.A.712(b) Quality System \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. The primary objectives of the quality system are to enable the CAMO to ensure airworthy \naircraft and to remain in compliance with the Part-M and, as applicable, Part-ML requirements. \n2. An essential element of the quality system is the independent audit. \n3. The independent audit is an objective process of routine sample checks of all aspects of the \nCAMO ability to carry out continuing airworthiness management to the required standards. It \nincludes some product sampling as this is the end result of the process. \n4. The independent audit represents an objective overview of the complete continuing \nairworthiness management related activities. It is intended to complement the M.A.902 or \nML.A.902 requirement for an airworthiness review to be satisfied that all aircraft managed by \nthe organisation remain airworthy. \n5. The independent audit should ensure that all aspects of M.A. Subpart G compliance are checked \nannually, including all the sub-contracted activities, and may be carried out as a complete single \nexercise or subdivided over the annual period in accordance with a scheduled plan. The \nindependent audit does not require each procedure to be checked against each product line \nwhen it can be shown that the particular procedure is common to more than one product line \nand the procedure has been checked every year without resultant findings. Where findings have \nbeen identified, the particular procedure should be rechecked against other product lines until \nthe findings have been rectified after which the independent audit procedure may revert back \nto the annual interval for the particular procedure. Provided that there are no safety related \nfindings, the audit time periods specified in this AMC may be increased by up to 100% subject \nto agreement by the competent authority. \n6. Where the organisation has more than one location approved the quality system should \ndescribe how these are integrated into the system and include a plan to audit each location \nevery year. \n7. A report should be raised each time an audit is carried out describing what was checked and \nthe resulting findings against applicable requirements, procedures and products. \n8. The independence of the audit should be established by always ensuring that audits are carried \nout by personnel not responsible for the function, procedure or products being checked. \n9. An organisation should establish a quality plan acceptable to the competent authority to show \nwhen and how often the activities as required by M.A. Subpart G will be audited. ",

The complexity of \nthe organisation, combination of aircraft and aircraft types, the utilisation of the aircraft and the \nnumber of approved locations of the organisations should also be considered before replacing the \nquality system by an organisational review. \nAppendix XIII to this AMC should be used to manage the organisational reviews. \nThe following activities should not be considered as subcontracting and, as a consequence, they may \nbe performed without a quality system, although they need to be described in the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition and be approved by the competent authority: \n− Subscription to a technical publisher that provides maintenance data (Aircraft Maintenance \nManuals, Illustrated Parts Catalogues, Service Bulletins, etc.), which may be applicable to a wide \nrange of aircraft. These data may include maintenance schedules recommended by different \nmanufacturers that can be afterwards used by the continuing airworthiness management \norganisation in order to produce customised maintenance programmes. \n− Contracting the use of a software tool for the management of continuing airworthiness data \nand records, under the following conditions (in addition to M.A.714(d) and (e)): \n− If the tool is used by several organisations, each organisation should have access to its \nown data only. \n− Introduction of data can only be performed by personnel of the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement organisation. \n− The data can be retrieved at any time. \nM.A.713 Changes to the approved continuing airworthiness \norganisation \nRegulation (EU) No 1321/2014 \nIn order to enable the competent authority to determine continued compliance with this Part, the \napproved continuing airworthiness management organisation shall notify it of any proposal to carry \nout any of the following changes, before such changes take place: \n1. the name of the organisation. \n2. the location of the organisation. \n3. additional locations of the organisation. \n4. the accountable manager. \n5. any of the persons specified in M.A.706(c). \n6. the facilities, procedures, work scope and staff that could affect the approval. \nIn the case of proposed changes in personnel not known to the management beforehand, these \nchanges shall be notified at the earliest opportunity.

The primary purpose of this \nparagraph is to enable the CAMO to remain approved if agreed by the competent authority during \nnegotiations about any of the specified changes. Without this paragraph the approval would \nautomatically be suspended in all cases. \nM.A.714 Record-keeping \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) The continuing airworthiness management organisation shall record all details of work carried \nout. The records required under point M.A.305 of this Annex (Part-M) or ML.A.305 of Annex Vb \n(Part-ML), as applicable, and if applicable point M.A.306 of this Annex (Part-M), shall be \nretained. \n(b) If the continuing airworthiness management organisation has the privilege referred to in point \nM.A.711(b), it shall retain a copy of each airworthiness review certificate and recommendation \nissued or, as applicable, extended, together with all supporting documents. In addition, the \norganisation shall retain a copy of any airworthiness review certificate that it has extended \nunder the privilege referred to in point M.A.711(a)4. \n(c) If the continuing airworthiness management organisation has the privilege referred to in point \nM.A.711(c), it shall retain a copy of each permit to fly issued in accordance with the provisions \nof point 21A.729 of Annex I (Part-21) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012. \n(d) The continuing airworthiness management organisation shall retain a copy of all records \nreferred to in points (b) and (c) until two years after the aircraft has been permanently \nwithdrawn from service. \n(e) The records shall be stored in a manner that ensures protection from damage, alteration and \ntheft. \n(f) All computer hardware used to ensure backup shall be stored in a different location from that \ncontaining the working data in an environment that ensures they remain in good condition. \n(g) Where continuing airworthiness management of an aircraft is transferred to another \norganisation or person, all retained records shall be transferred to the said organisation or \nperson. The time periods prescribed for the retention of records shall continue to apply to the \nsaid organisation or person. \n(h) Where a continuing airworthiness management organisation terminates its operation, all \nretained records shall be transferred to the owner of the aircraft. \nAMC M.A.714 Record-keeping \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. The CAMO should ensure that it always receives a complete CRS from the approved \nmaintenance organisation, M.A.801(b)(1) certifying staff and/or from the Pilot-owner such that \nthe required records can be retained. The system to keep the continuing airworthiness records \nshould be described in the organisation continuing airworthiness management exposition. \n2. When an organisation arranges for the relevant maintenance organisation to retain copies of \nthe continuing airworthiness records on its behalf, it will nevertheless continue to be ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 153 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nresponsible for the records under M.A.714 relating to the preservation of records. If it ceases \nto be the organisation of the aircraft, it also remains responsible for transferring the records to \nany other person or organisation managing continuing airworthiness of the aircraft. \n3. Keeping continuing airworthiness records in a form acceptable to the competent authority \nmeans in paper form or on a computer database or a combination of both methods. Records \nstored in microfilm or optical disc form are also acceptable. The record should remain legible \nthroughout the required retention period. \n4. Paper systems should use robust material which can withstand normal handling and filing. \n5. Computer systems should have at least one backup system which should be updated within \n24 hours of any new entry. Each terminal is required to contain programme safeguards against \nthe ability of unauthorised personnel to alter the database. \nMicrofilming or optical storage of continuing airworthiness records may be carried out at any time. \nThe records should be as legible as the original record and remain so for the required retention period. \nM.A.715 Continued validity of approval \nRegulation (EU) 2021/700 \n(a) An approval shall remain valid until 24 March 2022, subject to: \n1. the organisation remaining in compliance with this Part, in accordance with the \nprovisions related to the handling of findings as specified under point M.B.705 and; \n2. the competent authority being granted access to the organisation to determine \ncontinued compliance with this Part, and; \n3. the approval not being surrendered or revoked. \n(b) Upon surrender or revocation, the approval certificate shall be returned to the competent \nauthority. \nM.A.716 Findings \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) A level 1 finding is any significant non-compliance with the requirements of this Annex (Part-M) \nor Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable, which lowers the safety standard and hazards seriously \nthe flight safety; \n(b) A level 2 finding is any non-compliance with the requirements of this Annex (Part-M) or Annex \nVb (Part-ML), as applicable, which could lower the safety standard and possibly hazard the flight \nsafety. \n(c) After receipt of notification of findings according to point M.B.705, the holder of the continuing \nairworthiness management organisation approval shall define a corrective action plan and \ndemonstrate corrective action to the satisfaction of the competent authority within a period \nagreed with this authority.

The CRS shall be issued by an authorised certifying staff \nof the maintenance organisation approved in accordance with Subpart F of this Annex or with \nAnnex Vd (Part-CAO), except for maintenance tasks other than complex maintenance tasks \nlisted in Appendix VII to this Annex where the CRS is issued, alternatively by: \n1. independent certifying staff acting in accordance with the requirements laid down in \nArticle 5 of this Regulation; \n2. the pilot-owner acting in accordance with point M.A.803 of this Annex. \n(c) By derogation from point (b), in case of unforeseen situations, when an aircraft is grounded at \na location where no maintenance organisation approved in accordance with this Annex, \nAnnex II (Part-145) or Annex Vd (Part-CAO) and no independent certifying staff are available, \nthe owner may authorise any person, with no less than 3 years of appropriate maintenance \nexperience and holding either a valid ICAO Annex 1 compliant maintenance license for the \naircraft type requiring certification or a certifying staff authorisation valid for the work requiring \ncertification issued by an ICAO Annex 6 approved maintenance organisation to maintain the \naircraft in accordance with the standards set out in Subpart D of this Annex and release it to \nservice. In that case, the owner shall: \n1. obtain and keep in the aircraft records specifying details of the maintenance carried out \nand of the qualifications of the person issuing the CRS; \n2. ensure that any such maintenance is later on verified and a new CRS is issued by an \nappropriately authorised person referred to in point (b) or an organisation approved in \naccordance with Subpart F of this Annex, Annex II (Part-145) or Annex Vd (Part-CAO), at \nthe earliest opportunity and in any case within 7 calendar days from the issuance of a CRS \nby the person authorised by the owner; \n3. notify the organisation responsible for the continuing airworthiness management of the \naircraft, when contracted, or the competent authority in the absence of such a contract, \nwithin 7 days from the issuance of such authorisation. \n(d) In case of a release to service in accordance with point (b)(1), the certifying staff may be assisted \nin performing the maintenance tasks by one or more persons subject to his or her direct and \ncontinuous control. \n(e) A CRS shall contain at least: \n1. basic details of the maintenance carried out; \n2. the date on which the maintenance was completed; \n3. the identity of the organisation or person issuing the CRS, including, alternatively: \n(i) the approval reference of the maintenance organisation and the certifying staff \nissuing the CRS; ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 155 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(ii) in the case referred to in point (b)(2), the identity and, where applicable, the \nlicence number of the certifying staff issuing the CRS; \n4. the limitations to airworthiness or operations, if any. \n(f) By derogation from point (b) and notwithstanding point (g), when the required maintenance \ncannot be completed, a CRS may be issued with the approved aircraft limitations. In that case, \nthe certificate shall indicate that the maintenance could not be completed, as well as indicate \nany applicable airworthiness or operations limitations, as part of the information required by \npoint (e)(4). \n(g) A CRS shall not be issued in the case of any known non-compliance which endangers flight \nsafety. \nAMC M.A.801 Aircraft certificate of release to service after \nembodiment of a Standard Change or a Standard Repair (SC/SR) \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n1. Release to service and eligible persons \nOnly natural or legal persons entitled to release to service an aircraft after maintenance in \naccordance with Part-M, Part-145 or Part-CAO are considered as an eligible installer responsible \nfor the embodiment of a SC/SR when in compliance with applicable requirements. \nFor aircraft where there is no Part-66 licence applicable, the release to service of an aircraft \nafter embodiment of a SC/SR is only possible by holders of an appropriate certifying staff \nqualification valid in a Member State (national qualification), with the following conditions: \n− If the holder signs the release to service on behalf of an Approved Maintenance \nOrganisation (AMO), this is valid for aircraft registered in any Member State. \n− If the holder signs the release to service as an independent certifying staff (not on behalf \nof an AMO), this is only valid for aircraft registered in the Member State responsible for \nsuch certifying staff qualification. \nDepending on its nature, for certain SCs/SRs, the Certification Specification CS-STAN might \nrestrict the eligibility for the issuance of the release to service to certain persons. \nSince the design of the SC/SR does not require specific approval, the natural or legal person \nreleasing the aircraft to service after the embodiment of the change or repair takes the \nresponsibility that the applicable certification specifications within CS-STAN are fulfilled while \nbeing in compliance with Part-M, Part-145 and/or Part-CAO and not in conflict with data issued \nby the TC holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance. This includes \nresponsibility in respect of an adequate design, the selection/manufacturing of suitable parts \nand their identification, documenting the change or repair, generation or amendment of aircraft \nmanuals and instructions as needed, embodiment of the change/repair, releasing the aircraft \nto service and record-keeping. \n2. Parts and appliances to be installed as part of a SC/SR \nThe design of the parts and appliances to be used in a SC/SR is considered a part of the \nchange/repair, and, therefore, there is no need of a specific design approval. However, it is \npossible that for a particular SC, these Certification Specifications specifically require the use of \nparts and appliances that meet a technical standard. In this case, when the parts and appliances \nrequire to be authorised as an ETSO article, other articles recognised as equivalent by means of ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 156 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nan international safety agreement or grandfathered in accordance with Regulation (EU) \nNo 748/2012 are equally acceptable. \nNormally, a SC/SR shall not contain specifically designed parts that should be produced by a \nproduction organisation approved in accordance with Part-21 (POA). However, in the case that \nthe change or repair would contain such a part, it should be produced by an approved \nProduction Organisation (POA), and delivered with an EASA Form 1. An arrangement in \naccordance with 21.A.122(b) is not applicable. \nEligibility for installation of parts and appliances belonging to a SC/SR is subject to compliance \nwith the related provisions of Part 21, Part 21 Light, Part-M, Part-145 and Part-CAO, and the \nsituation varies depending on the aircraft in/on which the SC/SR is to be embodied, and who \nthe installer is. The need for an EASA Form 1 is addressed in Part 21, Part 21 Light and Part-M. \nFurthermore, Part-M Subpart F, Part-145 and Part-CAO contain provisions (i.e. M.A.603(c), \n145.A.42(c) and CAO.A.020(c)) allowing maintenance organisations to fabricate certain parts to \nbe installed in/on the aircraft as part of their maintenance activities. \n3. Parts and appliances identification \nThe parts modified or installed during the embodiment of the SC/SR need to be permanently \nmarked in accordance with Subpart Q of Part 21 or Subpart Q of Part 21 Light. \n4. Documenting the SC/SR and declaring compliance with the Certification Specifications \nIn accordance with Part-M, Part-CAO or Part-145 (e.g. AMC M.A.801 (e) and AMC 145.A.50(b)), \nthe legal or natural person responsible for the embodiment of a change or a repair should \ncompile details of the work accomplished. In the case of SCs/SRs, this includes, as necessary, \nbased on its complexity, an engineering file containing drawings, a list of the parts and \nappliances used for the change or repair, supporting analysis and the results of tests performed \nor any other evidence suitable to show that the design fulfils the applicable Certification \nSpecifications within CS-STAN together with a statement of compliance and amendments to \naircraft manuals, to instructions for continuing airworthiness and to other documents such as \naircraft parts list, wiring diagrams, etc., as deemed necessary. EASA Form 123 is prepared for \nthe purpose of documenting the preparation and embodiment of the SC/SR. The aircraft \nlogbook should contain an entry referring to EASA Form 123; both EASA Form 123 and the \nrelease to service required after the embodiment of the SC/SR should be signed by the same \nperson. \nForm 123 and all the records listed on it should follow elementary principles of controlled \ndocumentation, e.g. contain reference number of documents, issue dates, revision numbers, \nname of persons preparing/releasing the document, etc. \n5. Record-keeping \nThe legal or natural person responsible (see paragraph 1. above) for the embodiment of the \nchange/repair should keep the records generated with the SC/SR as required by Part-M or Part- \n145 and CS-STAN. \nIn addition, M.A.305 requires that the aircraft owner (or CAMO, if a contract i.a.w.

A release in accordance with this paragraph does not affect the controlled environment, in \naccordance with point (b) of M.A.901, of the aircraft as long as the M.A.801(c)2 recheck and \nrelease has been carried out by an approved maintenance organisation. \nAMC M.A.801(e) Aircraft certificate of release to service \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. The aircraft certificate of release to service should contain the following statement: \n(a) 'Certifies that the work specified except as otherwise specified was carried out in \naccordance with Part-M and in respect to that work the aircraft is considered ready for \nrelease to service'. \n(b) For a Pilot-owner a certificate of release to service should contain the following \nstatement: \n‘Certifies that the limited pilot-owner maintenance specified except as otherwise \nspecified was carried out in accordance with Part-M and in respect to that work the \naircraft is considered ready for release to service’. \n2. The certificate of release to service should relate to the task specified in the manufacturer's or \noperator's instruction or the aircraft maintenance programme which itself may cross-refer to a \nmanufacturer's/operator's instruction in a maintenance manual, service bulletin etc. \n3. The date such maintenance was carried out should include when the maintenance took place \nrelative to any life or overhaul limitation in terms of date/flying hours/cycles/ landings etc., as \nappropriate. \n4. When extensive maintenance has been carried out, it is acceptable for the certificate of release \nto service to summarise the maintenance so long as there is a unique cross-reference to the \nwork-pack containing full details of maintenance carried out. Dimensional information should \nbe retained in the work-pack record. \n5. The person issuing the certificate of release to service should use his normal signature except \nin the case where a computer release to service system is used. In this latter case the competent \nauthority will need to be satisfied that only the particular person can electronically issue the \nrelease to service. One such method of compliance is the use of a magnetic or optical personal \ncard in conjunction with a personal identity number (PIN) known only to the individual, which \nis keyed into the computer. A certification stamp is optional. \n6. At the completion of all maintenance, owners, certifying staff, operators and maintenance \norganisations should ensure they have a clear, concise, legible record of the work performed. \n7. In the case of an M.A.801(b)1 release to service, certifying staff should retain all records \nnecessary to prove that all requirements have been met for the issuance of a certificate of \nrelease to service.

Being unable to establish full compliance with sub-paragraph M.A.801(b) means that the \nmaintenance required by the aircraft owner, CAO or CAMO could not be completed due either \nto running out of available aircraft maintenance downtime or because the maintenance data \nrequires a flight to be performed as part of the maintenance, as described in paragraph 4. \n2. The aircraft owner, CAO or CAMO is responsible for ensuring that all required maintenance has \nbeen carried out before flight. Therefore, an aircraft owner, CAO or CAMO should be informed \nand agree to the deferment of full compliance with M.A.801(b). The certificate of release to \nservice may then be issued subject to details of the deferment, including the aircraft owner, \nCAO or CAMO authorisation, being endorsed on the certificate. \n3. If a CRS is issued with incomplete maintenance a record should be kept stating what action the \nmechanic, supervisor and certifying staff should take to bring the matter to the attention of the \nrelevant aircraft owner, CAO or CAMO so that the issue may be discussed and resolved with the \naircraft owner, CAO or CAMO. \n4. Certain maintenance data issued by the design approval holder or the declarant of a declaration \nof design compliance (e.g. aircraft maintenance manual (AMM)) requires that a maintenance \ntask be performed in flight as a necessary condition to complete the maintenance ordered. \nWithin the aircraft limitations, the person authorised to certify the maintenance per M.A.801 \nshould release the incomplete maintenance before this flight. GM M.A.301(i) describes the \nrelations with the aircraft operator, which retains the responsibility for the MCF. After \nperforming the flight and any additional maintenance necessary to complete the maintenance \nordered, a certificate of release to service should be issued in accordance with M.A.801. \nAMC M.A.801(g) Aircraft certificate of release to service \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n'Endangers flight safety’ means any instance where safe operation could not be assured or which could \nlead to an unsafe condition. It typically includes, but is not limited to, significant cracking, deformation, \ncorrosion or failure of primary structure, any evidence of burning, electrical arcing, significant \nhydraulic fluid or fuel leakage and any emergency system or total system failure. An AD overdue for \ncompliance is also considered a hazard to flight safety. \nM.A.802 Component certificate of release to service \nRegulation (EU) 2021/700 \n(a) Except for components released to service by a maintenance organisation that is approved in \naccordance with Annex II (Part-145) and for the cases covered by point (e) of point M.A.502, a \nCRS shall be issued at the completion of any maintenance work carried out on an aircraft \ncomponent in accordance with point M.A.502. \n(b) The authorised release certificate identified as EASA Form 1 constitutes the component CRS, \nexcept when such maintenance on aircraft components has been performed in accordance with \npoint (b) or (d) of point M.A.502 in which case the maintenance is subject to aircraft release \nprocedures in accordance with point M.A.801.

Privately operated means the aircraft is operated pursuant to M.A.201(i). \n2. A Pilot-owner may only issue a CRS for maintenance he/she has performed. \n3. In the case of a jointly-owned aircraft, the maintenance programme should list: \n− The names of all Pilot-owners competent and designated to perform Pilot-owner \nmaintenance in accordance with the basic principles described in Appendix VIII of Part- \nM. An alternative would be the maintenance programme to contain a procedure to \nensure how such a list of competent Pilot-owners should be managed separately and kept \ncurrent. ",

An equivalent valid pilot licence may be any document attesting a pilot qualification recognised \nby the Member State. It does not have to be necessarily issued by the competent authority, but \nit should in any case be issued in accordance with the particular Member State’s system. In such \na case, the equivalent certificate or qualification number should be used instead of the pilot's \nlicence number for the purpose of the M.A.801(b)(2) (certificate of release to service). \n5.

At the end, it is the responsibility \nof the airworthiness review staff to be satisfied that the aircraft complies with Part-M and is \nairworthy, and the organisation must ensure that no pressure or restrictions are imposed on \nthe airworthiness review staff when performing their duty. \n− A compliance report must be produced by the airworthiness review staff, detailing all items \nchecked and the outcome of the review. \n− Airworthiness review staff are responsible for the items checked during the airworthiness \nreview. However, they do not take over the responsibilities of the CAMO, maintenance \norganisation, DOA, POA or any other organisations, not being responsible for problems not \ndetected during the airworthiness review or for the possibility that the approved or declared \nmaintenance programme may not include certain recommendations from the design approval \nholder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance. Obviously, if the airworthiness \nreview staff are not independent of the airworthiness management process and were \nnominated on the basis of the option of having overall authority on such a process, they will be \nresponsible for the full continuing airworthiness of such aircraft. Nevertheless, this \nresponsibility will be a consequence of their position in the organisation and not of their \nfunction as airworthiness review staff. \n− The issuance of the airworthiness review certificate (ARC) by the airworthiness review staff only \ncertifies that the aircraft is considered airworthy in relation to the scope of the airworthiness \nreview performed and the fact that the airworthiness review staff are not aware of instances of \nnon-compliance which endanger flight safety. Furthermore, it only certifies that the aircraft is \nconsidered airworthy at the time of the review. \nIt is the responsibility of the owner or contracted CAMO or CAO to ensure that the aircraft is fully \nairworthy at any time. \nGM M.A.901(a) Aircraft airworthiness review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nEASA Form 15a is issued by competent authorities while EASA Form 15b is issued by a CAMO or CAO \norganisation.

The fact that limited pilot-owner maintenance as defined in M.A.803(b) is not carried out and \nreleased by an approved maintenance organisation does not change the status of an aircraft in \na controlled environment providing the CAMO under contract has been informed of any such \nmaintenance carried out. \nAMC M.A.901(c)2, (e)2 and (f) Aircraft airworthiness review \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nWhen the aircraft has remained within a controlled environment, the extension of the validity of the \nairworthiness review certificate does not require an airworthiness review but only a verification of the \ncontinuous compliance with M.A.901(b). \nIt is acceptable to anticipate the extension of the airworthiness review certificate by a maximum of 30 \ndays without a loss of continuity of the airworthiness review pattern, which means that the new \nexpiration date is set up one year after the previous expiration date. This anticipation of up to 30 days \nalso applies to the 12 month requirements shown in M.A.901(b), meaning that the aircraft is still \nconsidered as being in a controlled environment if it has been continuously managed by a single \norganisation and maintained by appropriately approved organisations, as stated in M.A.901(b), from \nthe date when the last airworthiness review certificate was issued until the date when the extension \nis performed (this can be up to 30 days less than 12 months). \nIt is also acceptable to perform the extension of an airworthiness review certificate after its expiration \ndate, as long as all the conditions for the extension are met. However, this means the following: \n− The aircraft could not fly since the airworthiness review certificate expired until it is extended, \nand \n− The new expiration date (after extension) is set one year after the previous expiration date (not \none year after the extension is performed). \nAMC M.A.901(d) Aircraft airworthiness review \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nThe recommendation sent by a CAMO or CAO to the competent authority of the Member State of \nregistry should be, at least, in English when the Member State of registry is different from the \nCAMO/CAO’s Member State.

A full documented review is a check of at least the following categories of documents: \n— registration papers; \n— M.A.305 aircraft continuing airworthiness record system; \n— M.A.306 aircraft technical log system; \n— list of deferred defects, minimum equipment list and configuration deviation, list if \napplicable; \n— aircraft flight manual including aircraft configuration; \n— aircraft maintenance programme; \n— maintenance data; \n— relevant work packages; \n— AD status; \n— modification and SB status; \n— modification and repair approval sheets; \n— status of life-limited parts and time-controlled components; \n— relevant EASA Form 1 or equivalent; \n— mass and balance report and equipment list; \n— aircraft, engine and propeller TC data sheets or airworthiness data sheet (for aircraft \nsubject to a declaration of design compliance). ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 171 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAs a minimum, sample checks within each document category should be carried out. \n2. The CAMO or CAO should develop procedures for the airworthiness review staff to produce a \ncompliance report that confirms the above have been reviewed and found in compliance with \nPart-M. \nAMC M.A.901(l) and (m) Aircraft airworthiness review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nPHYSICAL SURVEY \n1. The physical survey could require actions categorised as maintenance (e.g. operational tests, \ntests of emergency equipment, visual inspections requiring panel opening, etc.). In this case, \nafter the airworthiness review, a release to service should be issued. \n2. When the airworthiness review staff are not appropriately qualified as per Part-66 in order to \nrelease such maintenance, M.A.901(l) requires them to be assisted by such qualified personnel. \nHowever, the function of such Part-66 personnel is limited to performing and releasing the \nmaintenance actions requested by the airworthiness review staff, it not being their function to \nperform the physical survey of the aircraft. \n3. This means that the airworthiness review staff who is going to sign the airworthiness review \ncertificate or the recommendation should be the one performing both the documented review \nand the physical survey of the aircraft. It is not the intent of the rule to delegate the survey to \nPart-66 personnel who are not airworthiness review staff. Furthermore, the provision of \nM.A.901(n) that allows a 90-day anticipation for the physical survey provides enough flexibility \nto ensure that the airworthiness review staff (ARS) are present. \n4. The physical survey may include verifications to be carried out during flight. \n5. The CAMO or CAO should develop procedures for the ARS to produce a compliance report that \nconfirms that the physical survey has been carried out and found satisfactory. \n6. To ensure compliance, the physical survey may include relevant sample checks of items. \nAMC M.A.901(n) Aircraft airworthiness review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n‘Without loss of continuity of the airworthiness review pattern’ means that the new expiration date is \nset up 1 year after the previous expiration date. As a consequence, when the airworthiness review is \nanticipated, the validity or the airworthiness review certificate is longer than 1 year (up to 90 days \nlonger). \nThis anticipation of up to 90 days also applies to the 12-month requirements shown in M.A.901(b), \nwhich means that the aircraft is still considered as being in a controlled environment if it has been \ncontinuously managed by a single organisation and maintained by appropriately approved \norganisations, as stated in M.A.901(b), from the date when the last airworthiness review certificate \nwas issued until the date when the new airworthiness review is performed (this can be up to 90 days \nless than 12 months). \nAMC M.A.901(o) Airworthiness review \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nA copy of both the physical survey and document review compliance reports stated above should be \nsent to the competent authority together with any recommendation issued.

The competent authority should determine by whom, and how the audit shall be conducted. \nFor example, it will be necessary to determine whether one large team audit or a short series \nof small team audits or a long series of single man audits are most appropriate for the particular \nsituation. \n2. The audit may be carried out on a product line type basis. For example, in the case of an \norganisation with Socata TB20 and Piper PA28 ratings, the audit is concentrated on one type \nonly for a full compliance check. Dependent upon the result, the second type may only require \na sample check that should at least cover the activities identified as weak for the first type. \n3. The competent authority auditing surveyor should always ensure that he/she is accompanied \nthroughout the audit by a senior technical member of the organisation. The reason for being \naccompanied is to ensure the organisation is fully aware of any findings during the audit. \n4. The auditing surveyor should inform the senior technical member of the organisation at the end \nof the audit visit on all findings made during the audit. \nAMC M.B.602(e) Initial approval \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1. Findings should be recorded on an audit report form with a provisional categorisation as a level \n1 or 2. Subsequent to the audit visit that identified the particular findings, the competent \nauthority should review the provisional finding levels, adjusting them if necessary and change \nthe categorisation from ‘provisional’ to ‘confirmed’. \n2. All findings should be confirmed in writing to the applicant organisation within 2 weeks of the \naudit visit. \n3. There may be occasions when the competent authority finds situations in the applicant's \norganisation on which it is unsure about compliance. In this case, the organisation should be \ninformed about possible non-compliance at the time and the fact that the situation will be \nreviewed within the competent authority before a decision is made. If the review concludes \nthat there is no finding then a verbal confirmation to the organisation will suffice. \nAMC M.B.602(f) Initial approval \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1. The audit report should be made on an EASA Form 6F (see appendix VI). \n2. A quality review of the EASA Form 6F audit report should be carried out by a competent \nindependent person nominated by the competent authority. The review should take into \naccount the relevant paragraphs of M.A. Subpart F, the categorisation of finding levels and the \nclosure action taken. Satisfactory review of the audit form should be indicated by a signature \non the EASA Form 6F. ",

For approvals involving more than one competent authority, the approval should be granted in \nconjunction with the competent authorities of the Member States in whose territories the other \nmaintenance organisation facilities are located. For practical reasons the initial approval should \nbe granted on the basis of a joint audit visit by the approving competent authority and \ncompetent authorities of the Member States in whose territories the other maintenance \norganisation facilities are located. Audits related to the continuation of the approval should be \ndelegated to the competent authorities of the Member States in whose territories the other \nmaintenance organisation facilities are located. The resulting audit form and recommendation \nshould then be submitted to the approving competent authority. \n2. The approval should be based upon the organisational capability relative to M.A. Subpart F \ncompliance and not limited by reference to individual EASA certificated products. \nFor example, if the organisation is capable of maintaining within the limitation of M.A. Subpart F \nthe Cessna 100 series aircraft the approval schedule should state A2 Cessna 100 series and not \nCessna 172RG which is a particular designator for one of many Cessna 100 series. \n3. Special case for ELA1 aircraft: \nIn order to promote standardisation, for this category of aircraft the following approach is \nrecommended: \n− Possible ratings to be endorsed in EASA Form 3: \n− ELA1 sailplanes; \n− ELA1 powered sailplanes and ELA1 aeroplanes; \n− ELA1 balloons; \n− ELA1 airships. \n− Before endorsing any of those ratings (for example, ELA1 sailplanes) in EASA Form 3, the \ncompetent authority should audit that the organisation is capable of maintaining at least \none aircraft type (for example, one type of sailplanes within the ELA1 category), including ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION B — PROCEDURE FOR \nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES  Page 195 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nthe availability of the necessary facilities, equipment, tooling, material, maintenance \ndata, and certifying staff. \n− It is acceptable that the detailed scope of work in the Maintenance Organisation Manual \n(MOM) contains the same ratings endorsed in EASA Form 3 (for example, ELA1 \nsailplanes), without a need to further limit them. However, the maintenance organisation \nwill only be able to maintain a certain aircraft type when all the necessary facilities, \nequipment, tooling, material, maintenance data, and certifying staff are available. \nAMC M.B.603(c) Issue of approval \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nThe numeric sequence of the approval reference should be unique to the particular approved \nmaintenance organisation. \nM.B.604 Continuing oversight \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1383 \n(a) The competent authority shall keep and update a programme listing, for each maintenance \norganisation approved in accordance with Subpart F of Section B of this Annex under its \nsupervision, the dates when audit visits are due and when such visits were carried out. \n(b) Each organisation shall be completely audited at periods not exceeding 24 months. \n(c) All findings shall be confirmed in writing to the applicant organisation. \n(d) The competent authority shall record all findings, closure actions (actions required to close a \nfinding) and recommendations. \n(e) A meeting with the accountable manager shall be convened at least once every 24 months to \nensure he/she remains informed of significant issues arising during audits. \nAMC M.B.604(b) Continuing oversight \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. Where the competent authority has decided that a series of audit visits are necessary to arrive \nat a complete audit of an approved maintenance organisation, the program should indicate \nwhich aspects of the approval will be covered on each visit. \n2. It is recommended that part of an audit concentrates on the organisations internal self \nmonitoring reports produced by the organisational review to determine if the organisation is \nidentifying and correcting its problems. \n3. At the successful conclusion of the audit(s) including verification of the manual, an audit report \nform should be completed by the auditing surveyor including all recorded findings, closure \nactions and recommendation. An EASA Form 6F should be used for this activity. \n4. Credit may be claimed by the competent authority surveyor(s) for specific item audits \ncompleted during the preceding 23-month period subject to four conditions: \n(a) the specific item audit should be the same as that required by M.A. Subpart F latest \namendment, and \n(b) there should be satisfactory evidence on record that such specific item audits were \ncarried out and that all corrective actions have been taken, and ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION B — PROCEDURE FOR \nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES  Page 196 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(c) the competent authority surveyor(s) should be satisfied that there is no reason to believe \nstandards have deteriorated in respect of those specific item audits being granted a back \ncredit; \n(d) the specific item audit being granted a back credit should be audited not later than 24 \nmonths after the last audit of the item. \n5. When performing the oversight of an organisation that holds more than one approval pursuant \nto this Regulation, the competent authority should arrange the audits to cover both approvals \navoiding a duplicated visit of a particular area. \nM.B.605 Findings \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1383 \n(a) When during audits or by other means evidence is found showing non-compliance with a \nrequirement laid down in this Annex or Annex Vb (Part-ML), the competent authority shall take \nthe following actions: \n1. For level 1 findings, immediate action shall be taken by the competent authority to \nrevoke, limit or suspend in whole or in part, depending upon the extent of the level 1 \nfinding, the maintenance organisation approval, until successful corrective action has \nbeen taken by the organisation. \n2. For level 2 findings, the competent authority shall grant a corrective action period \nappropriate to the nature of the finding that shall not be more than three months. In \ncertain circumstances, at the end of this first period and subject to the nature of the \nfinding, the competent authority can extend the three month period subject to a \nsatisfactory corrective action plan. \n(b) Action shall be taken by the competent authority to suspend in whole or part the approval in \ncase of failure to comply within the timescale granted by the competent authority. \nAMC M.B.605(a)(1) Findings \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nFor a level 1 finding it may be necessary for the competent authority to ensure that further \nmaintenance and re-certification of all affected products is accomplished, dependent upon the nature \nof the finding. \nM.B.606 Changes \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1383 \n(a) The competent authority shall comply with the applicable elements of the initial approval for \nany change to the organisation notified in accordance with point M.A.617. \n(b) The competent authority may prescribe the conditions under which the approved maintenance \norganisation may operate during such changes, unless it determines that the approval should \nbe suspended due to the nature or the extent of the changes. \n(c) For any change to the maintenance organisation manual: \n1. in the case of direct approval of changes in accordance with point (b) of point M.A.604, \nthe competent authority shall verify that the procedures specified in the manual are in \ncompliance with this Annex before formally notifying the approved organisation of the \napproval; ",

Changes in nominated persons. \nThe competent authority should have adequate control over any changes to personnel specified \nin M.A.606(a) and (b). Such changes will require an amendment to the manual. \n2. It is recommended that a simple manual status sheet is maintained which contains information \non when an amendment was received by the competent authority and when it was approved. \n3. The competent authority should define the minor amendments to the manual which may be \nincorporated through indirect approval. In this case a procedure should be stated in the \namendment section of the maintenance organisation manual. \nChanges notified in accordance with M.A.617 are not considered minor. \nFor all cases other than minor, the applicable part(s) of the EASA Form 6F should be used for \nthe change. \n4. The approved maintenance organisation should submit each manual amendment to the \ncompetent authority whether it be an amendment for competent authority approval or an \nindirectly approved amendment. Where the amendment requires competent authority \napproval, the competent authority when satisfied, should indicate its approval in writing. Where \nthe amendment has been submitted under the indirect approval procedure the competent \nauthority should acknowledge receipt in writing. \nM.B.607 Revocation, suspension and limitation of an approval \nRegulation (EU) No 1321/2014 \nThe competent authority shall: \n(a) suspend an approval on reasonable grounds in the case of potential safety threat, or; \n(b) suspend, revoke or limit an approval pursuant to point M.B.605.

It is this scope of work in \nthe CAME which ultimately defines the approval of the organisation. As a consequence, it is possible \nfor a competent authority to endorse in EASA Form 14, for example, a scope of work for Group 3 \naircraft while the detailed scope of work defined in the CAME does not include all Group 3 aircraft. \nNevertheless, in all cases, the competent authority should be satisfied that the organisation has the \ncapability to manage the types/groups/series endorsed in the EASA Form 14. \nSince the activities linked to continuing airworthiness management are mainly process-oriented rather \nthan facility/tooling-oriented, changes to the detailed scope of work defined in the CAME (either \ndirectly or through a capability list), within the limits already included in EASA Form 14, may be \nconsidered as not affecting the approval and not subject to M.A.713. As a consequence, for these \nchanges the competent authority may allow the use by the CAMO of the indirect approval procedure \ndefined in M.A.704(c). \nIn the example mentioned above, before endorsing the Group 3 in EASA Form 14 for the first time, \nthe competent authority should make sure that the organisation is capable of managing this category ",

In particular, the competent authority should ensure that Baseline/Generic \nMaintenance Programmes (see M.A.709) or individual maintenance programmes (for contracted \ncustomers) are available for all the aircraft which are intended to be initially included in the scope of \nwork detailed in the CAME. Later on, if changes need to be introduced in the detailed scope of work \ndetailed in the CAME to include new aircraft types (within Group 3), this may be done by the CAMO \nthrough the use of the indirect approval procedure. \nSince, as mentioned above, the competent authority should make sure that the organisation is capable \nof managing the requested category as a whole, it is not reasonable to grant a full Group 3 approval \nbased on an intended scope of work which is limited to, for example, a Cessna 172 aircraft. However, \nit may be reasonable to grant such full Group 3 approval, after showing appropriate capability, for an \nintended scope of work covering several aircraft types or series of different complexity and which are \nrepresentative of the full Group 3. \nSpecial case for ELA1 aircraft: \nIn order to promote standardisation, for this category of aircraft the following approach is \nrecommended: \n− Possible ratings to be endorsed in EASA Form 14: \n− ELA1 sailplanes; \n− ELA1 powered sailplanes and ELA1 aeroplanes; \n− ELA1 balloons; \n− ELA1 airships. \n− Before endorsing any of those ratings (for example, ELA1 sailplanes) in EASA Form 14, the \ncompetent authority should audit that the organisation is capable of managing at least one \naircraft type (for example, one type of sailplanes within the ELA1 category), including the \navailability of the necessary facilities, data, maintenance programmes, and staff. \n− It is acceptable that the detailed scope of work in the CAME contains the same ratings endorsed \nin EASA Form 14 (for example, ELA1 sailplanes), without a need to further limit them. However, \nthe CAMO will only be able to manage a certain aircraft type when all the necessary facilities, \ndata, maintenance programmes and staff are available. \nAMC M.B.703(a) Issue of approval \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nFor approvals involving more than one competent authority, the approval should be granted in \nconjunction with the competent authority of the Member States in whose territories the other \ncontinuing airworthiness management organisation facilities are located. For practical reasons the \ninitial approval should be granted on the basis of a joint audit visit by the approving competent \nauthority and competent authority of the Member States in whose territories the other continuing \nairworthiness management organisation facilities are located. Audits related to the renewal of the \napproval should be delegated to the competent authority of the Member States in whose territories \nthe other continuing airworthiness management organisation facilities are located. The resulting audit \nform and recommendation should then be submitted to the approving competent authority. ",

The size of the \nsample will be decided by the competent authority based on the result of prior audits and \nearlier product surveys. \n(d) All findings shall be confirmed in writing to the applicant organisation. \n(e) The competent authority shall record all findings, closure actions (actions required to close a \nfinding) and recommendations. \n(f) A meeting with the accountable manager shall be convened at least once every 24 months to \nensure he/she remains informed of significant issues arising during audits. \nAMC M.B.704(b) Continuing oversight \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. Where the competent authority has decided that a series of audit visits are necessary to arrive \nat a complete audit of an approved continuing airworthiness management organisation, the \nprogram should indicate which aspects of the approval will be covered on each visit. \n2. It is recommended that part of an audit concentrates on two ongoing aspects of the \nM.A. Subpart G approval, namely the organisations internal self monitoring quality reports \nproduced by the quality monitoring personnel to determine if the organisation is identifying \nand correcting its problems and secondly the number of concessions granted by the quality \nmanager. \n3. At the successful conclusion of the audit(s) including verification of the exposition, an audit \nreport form should be completed by the auditing surveyor including all recorded findings, \nclosure actions and recommendation. An EASA Form 13 should be used for this activity. \n4. Credit may be claimed by the competent authority surveyor(s) for specific item audits \ncompleted during the preceding 23 month period subject to four conditions: \n(a) the specific item audit should be the same as that required by M.A. Subpart G latest \namendment, and \n(b) there should be satisfactory evidence on record that such specific item audits were \ncarried out and that all corrective actions have been taken, and \n(c) the competent authority surveyor(s) should be satisfied that there is no reason to believe \nstandards have deteriorated in respect of those specific item audits being granted a back \ncredit; ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION B — PROCEDURE FOR \nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES  Page 204 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(d) the specific item audit being granted a back credit should be audited not later than 24 \nmonths after the last audit of the item. \n5. When a CAMO sub-contracts continuing airworthiness management tasks all sub-contracted \norganisations should also be audited by the competent authority at periods not exceeding \n24 months (credits per paragraph 4 above are permitted) to ensure they fully comply with \nM.A. Subpart G. For these audits, the competent authority auditing surveyor should always \nensure that he/she is accompanied throughout the audit by a senior technical member of the \nCAMO. All findings should be sent to and corrected by the CAMO. \n6. When performing the oversight of organisations that hold various approvals, the competent \nauthority should arrange the audits to cover all approvals avoiding a duplicated visit of a \nparticular area. \nM.B.705 Findings \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) When during audits or by other means, evidence is found showing non-compliance to a \nrequirement laid down in this Annex (Part-M) or Annex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable, the \ncompetent authority shall take the following actions: \n1. For level 1 findings, immediate action shall be taken by the competent authority to \nrevoke, limit or suspend in whole or in part, depending upon the extent of the level 1 \nfinding, the continuing airworthiness management organisation approval, until successful \ncorrective action has been taken by the organisation. \n2. For level 2 findings, the competent authority shall grant a corrective action period \nappropriate to the nature of the finding that shall not be more than three months. In \ncertain circumstances, at the end of this first period, and subject to the nature of the \nfinding the competent authority can extend the three month period subject to a \nsatisfactory corrective action plan. \n(b) Action shall be taken by the competent authority to suspend in whole or part the approval in \ncase of failure to comply within the timescale granted by the competent authority. \nAMC M.B.705(a)(1) Findings \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nFor a level 1 finding the competent authority should inform the owner/operator and the competent \nauthority of any potentially affected aircraft in order that corrective action can be taken to ensure \npossible unsafe conditions on these aircraft are corrected before further flight. \nFurthermore, a level 1 finding could lead to a non-compliance to be found on an aircraft as specified \nin M.B.303(f). \nM.B.706 Changes \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) The competent authority shall comply with the applicable elements of the initial approval for \nany change to the organisation notified in accordance with point M.A.713. \n(b) The competent authority may prescribe the conditions under which the approved continuing \nairworthiness management organisation may operate during such changes unless it determines \nthat the approval should be suspended due to the nature or the extent of the changes.

In the case an indirect approval procedure is used for the approval of the changes in \naccordance with point M.A.704(c) of this Annex (Part-M), the competent authority shall \nensure all of the following: \n(i) that the changes remain minor; \n(ii) that it has an adequate control over the approval of the changes to ensure they \nremain in compliance with the requirements of this Annex (Part-M) or Annex Vb \n(Part-ML), as applicable. \nAMC M.B.706 Changes \nED Decision 2016/011/R \n1. Changes in nominated persons. The competent authority should have adequate control over \nany changes to the personnel specified in M.A.706(a), (c), (d) and (i). Such changes will require \nan amendment to the exposition. \n2. It is recommended that a simple exposition status sheet is maintained which contains \ninformation on when an amendment was received by the competent authority and when it was \napproved. \n3. The competent authority should define the minor amendments to the exposition which may be \nincorporated through indirect approval. In this case a procedure should be stated in the \namendment section of the approved continuing airworthiness management exposition. \n4. Changes notified in accordance with M.A.713 are not considered minor. For all cases other than \nminor, the applicable part(s) of the EASA Form 13 should be used for the change. \n5. The CAMO should submit each exposition amendment to the competent authority whether it \nbe an amendment for competent authority approval or an indirectly approved amendment. \nWhere the amendment requires competent authority approval, the competent authority when \nsatisfied, should indicate its approval in writing. Where the amendment has been submitted \nunder the indirect approval procedure the competent authority should acknowledge receipt in \nwriting. \nM.B.707 Revocation, suspension and limitation of an approval \nRegulation (EU) No 1321/2014 \nThe competent authority shall: \n(a) suspend an approval on reasonable grounds in the case of potential safety threat, or; \n(b) suspend, revoke or limit an approval pursuant to point M.B.705.

Appropriately qualified personnel of the competent authority shall verify that the compliance \nstatement contained in the recommendation demonstrates that a complete airworthiness \nreview in accordance with point M.A.901 has been carried out. \n2. The competent authority shall investigate and may request further information to support the \nassessment of the recommendation. \nAMC M.B.901 Assessment of recommendations \nED Decision 2021/009/R \n1. The result of the verification and the investigation of a recommendation should be sent to the \napplicant within 30 days. If corrective action has been requested before the issuance of an \nairworthiness review certificate, the competent authority may decide a further period for the \nassessment of the requested corrective action. \n2. The verification of the compliance statement required by M.B.901 does not mean repeating the \nairworthiness review itself. However, the competent authority should verify that the \nCAMO/CAO has carried out a complete and accurate assessment of the airworthiness of the \naircraft. \n3. Depending on the content of the recommendation, the history of the particular aircraft, and the \nknowledge of the CAMO/CAO making the recommendation in terms of experience, number and \ncorrection of findings and previous recommendations the extent of the investigation will vary. \nTherefore, whenever possible the person carrying out the investigation should be involved in \nthe oversight of the CAMO/CAO making the recommendation. \n4. In some cases, the inspector may decide that it is necessary to organise: \n— a physical survey of the aircraft, or \n— a full or partial airworthiness review. \nIn this case, the inspector should inform the CAMO/CAO making the recommendation with \nsufficient notice so that it may organise itself according to M.A.901(i). \nFurthermore, this part of the investigation should be carried out by appropriate airworthiness \nreview staff in accordance with M.B.902(b). \n5.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 228 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAppendix IV — Class and rating system for the terms of approval of \nmaintenance organisations referred to in Annex I (Part-M), \nSubpart F \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1963 \n1. Except as stated otherwise for the smallest organisations referred to in point 11, the table in \npoint 12 provides for the standard system for the approval of a maintenance organisation \nreferred to in Annex I (Part-M), Subpart F. An organisation must be granted an approval that \nranges from a single class and rating with limitations to all classes and ratings with limitations. \n2. In addition to the table referred to in point 12, the approved maintenance organisation is \nrequired to indicate its scope of work in its maintenance organisation manual. \n3. Within the approval class(es) and rating(s) granted by the competent authority, the scope of \nwork specified in the maintenance organisation exposition defines the exact limits of approval. \nIt is therefore essential that the approval class(es) and rating(s) and the organisations scope of \nwork are matching. \n4. A category A class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out \nmaintenance on the aircraft and any component (including engines and/or Auxiliary Power \nUnits (APUs), in accordance with aircraft maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent \nauthority, in accordance with component maintenance data, only whilst such components are \nfitted to the aircraft. Nevertheless, such A-rated approved maintenance organisation may \ntemporarily remove a component for maintenance, in order to improve access to that \ncomponent, except when such removal generates the need for additional maintenance not \neligible for the provisions of this point. This will be subject to a control procedure in the \nmaintenance organisation exposition to be approved by the competent authority. The \nlimitation section will specify the scope of such maintenance thereby indicating the extent of \napproval. \n5. A category B class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out \nmaintenance on the uninstalled engine and/or APU and engine and/or APU components, in \naccordance with engine and/or APU maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, \nin accordance with component maintenance data, only whilst such components are fitted to \nthe engine and/or APU. Nevertheless, such B-rated approved maintenance organisation may \ntemporarily remove a component for maintenance, in order to improve access to that \ncomponent, except when such removal generates the need for additional maintenance not \neligible for the provisions of this point. The limitation section will specify the scope of such \nmaintenance thereby indicating the extent of approval. A maintenance organisation approved \nwith a category B class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed engine during \n‘base’ and ‘line’ maintenance subject to a control procedure in the maintenance organisation \nexposition to be approved by the competent authority. The maintenance organisation \nexposition scope of work shall reflect such activity where permitted by the competent authority. \n6. A category C class rating means that the approved maintenance organisation may carry out \nmaintenance on uninstalled components (excluding engines and APUs) intended for fitment to \nthe aircraft or engine/APU. The limitation section will specify the scope of such maintenance \nthereby indicating the extent of approval. A maintenance organisation approved with a \ncategory C class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed component during base \nand line maintenance or at an engine/APU maintenance facility subject to a control procedure \nin the maintenance organisation exposition to be approved by the competent authority. The ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 229 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nmaintenance organisation exposition scope of work shall reflect such activity where permitted \nby the competent authority. \n7. A category D class rating is a self contained class rating not necessarily related to a specific \naircraft, engine or other component. The D1 — Non Destructive Testing (NDT) rating is only \nnecessary for an approved maintenance organisation that carries out NDT as a particular task \nfor another organisation. A maintenance organisation approved with a class rating in A or B or \nC category may carry out NDT on products it is maintaining subject to the maintenance \norganisation exposition containing NDT procedures, without the need for a D1 class rating. \n8. The limitation section is intended to give the competent authorities the flexibility to customise \nthe approval to any particular organisation. Ratings shall be mentioned on the approval only \nwhen appropriately limited. The table referred to in point 12 specifies the types of limitation \npossible. Whilst maintenance is listed last in each class rating it is acceptable to stress the \nmaintenance task rather than the aircraft or engine type or manufacturer, if this is more \nappropriate to the organisation (an example could be avionic systems installations and related \nmaintenance). Such mention in the limitation section indicates that the maintenance \norganisation is approved to carry out maintenance up to and including this particular type/task. \n9. When reference is made to series, type and group in the limitation section of class A and B, \nseries means a specific type series such as Cessna 150 or Cessna 172 or Beech 55 series or \ncontinental O-200 series etc; type means a specific type or model such as Cessna 172RG type; \nany number of series or types may be quoted; group means for example Cessna single piston \nengine aircraft or Lycoming non-supercharged piston engines, etc. \n10. When a lengthy capability list is used which could be subject to frequent amendments, then \nsuch amendments may be performed in accordance with the indirect approval procedure \nreferred to in points M.A.604(c) and M.B.606(c). \n11. A maintenance organisation which employs only one person to both plan and carry out all \nmaintenance can only hold a limited scope of approval rating. The maximum permissible limits \nare: \nCLASS RATING LIMITATION \nCLASS AIRCRAFT RATING A2 AEROPLANES 5700 \nKG AND BELOW \nPISTON ENGINE 5700 KG AND \nBELOW \nCLASS AIRCRAFT RATING A3 HELICOPTERS SINGLE PISTON ENGINE 3175 \nKG AND BELOW \nCLASS AIRCRAFT RATING A4 AIRCRAFT OTHER \nTHAN A1, A2 AND A3 \nNO LIMITATION \nCLASS ENGINES RATING B2 PISTON LESS THAN 450 HP \nCLASS COMPONENTS OTHER \nTHAN COMPLETE ENGINES OR \nAPUs. \nC1 TO C22 AS PER CAPABILITY LIST \nCLASS SPECIALISED D1 NDT NDT METHOD(S) TO BE \nSPECIFIED. \nIt should be noted that such an organisation may be further limited by the competent authority \nin the terms of approval depending on the capability of the particular organisation.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 240 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAppendix VIII — Limited Pilot-owner Maintenance \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \nIn addition to the requirements laid down in Annex I (Part-M), the following basic principles are to be \ncomplied with before any maintenance task is carried out under the terms of Pilot-owner \nmaintenance: \n(a) Competence and responsibility \n1. The Pilot-owner is always responsible for any maintenance that he performs. \n2. Before carrying out any Pilot-owner maintenance tasks, the Pilot-owner must satisfy \nhimself that he is competent to do the task. It is the responsibility of Pilot-owners to \nfamiliarize themselves with the standard maintenance practices for their aircraft and with \nthe aircraft maintenance programme. If the Pilot-owner is not competent for the task to \nbe carried out, the task cannot be released by the Pilot-owner. \n3. The Pilot-owner (or his contracted CAMO or CAO) is responsible for identifying the Pilot- \nowner tasks according to these basic principles in the maintenance programme and for \nensuring that the document is updated in a timely manner. \n4. The approval of the maintenance programme has to be carried out in accordance with \npoint M.A.302. \n(b) Tasks \nThe Pilot-owner may carry out simple visual inspections or operations to check for general \ncondition and obvious damage and normal operation of the airframe, engines, systems and \ncomponents. \nMaintenance tasks shall not be carried out by the Pilot-owner when the task: \n1. is a critical maintenance task; \n2. requires the removal of major components or major assembly and/or; \n3. is carried out in compliance with an Airworthiness Directive or an Airworthiness \nLimitation Item, unless specifically allowed in the AD or the ALI and/or; \n4. requires the use of special tools, calibrated tools (except torque wrench and crimping \ntool) and/or; \n5. requires the use of test equipments or special testing (e.g. NDT, system tests or \noperational checks for avionic equipment) and/or; \n6. is composed of any unscheduled special inspections (e.g. heavy landing check) and/or; \n7. is effecting systems essential for the IFR operations and/or; \n8. is listed in Appendix VII to this Annex or is a component maintenance task in accordance \nwith points M.A.502(a), (b), (c) or (d). \nThe criteria 1 to 8 cannot be overridden by less restrictive instructions issued in accordance with \n‘M.A.302(d) Maintenance Programme’. \nAny task described in the aircraft flight manual as preparing the aircraft for flight (Example: \nassembling the glider wings or pre-flight), is considered to be a pilot task and is not considered \na Pilot-owner maintenance task and therefore does not require a Certificate of Release to \nService. \n(c) Performance of the maintenance Pilot-owner tasks and records ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 241 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nThe maintenance data as specified in point M.A.401 must be always available during the \nconduct of Pilot-owner maintenance and must be complied with. Details of the data referred to \nin the conduct of Pilot-owner maintenance must be included in the Certificate of Release to \nService in accordance with point M.A.803(d). \nThe Pilot-owner must inform the approved continuing airworthiness management organisation \nresponsible for the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft (if applicable) not later than 30 days \nafter completion of the Pilot-owner maintenance task in accordance with point M.A.305(a). \nAMC to Appendix VIII — Limited Pilot-owner Maintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n1. The lists here below specify items that can be expected to be completed by an owner who holds \na current and valid pilot licence for the aircraft type involved and who meets the competence \nand responsibility requirements of Appendix VIII to Part-M. \n2. The list of tasks may not address in a detailed manner the specific needs of the various aircraft \ncategories. In addition, the development of technology and the nature of the operations \nundertaken by these categories of aircraft cannot be always adequately considered. \n3. Therefore, the following lists are considered to be the representative scope of limited Pilot- \nowner maintenance referred to in M.A.803 and Appendix VIII: \n− Part A applies to aeroplanes; \n− Part B applies to rotorcraft; \n− Part C applies to sailplanes and powered sailplanes; \n− Part D applies to balloons and airships. \n4. Inspection tasks/checks of any periodicity included in an approved maintenance programme \ncan be carried out providing that the specified tasks are included in the generic lists of Parts A \nto D of this AMC and remain compliant with Part M Appendix VIII basic principles. \nThe content of periodic inspections/checks, as well as their periodicity, is not regulated or \nstandardised in an aviation specification. It is the decision of the manufacturer/Type Certificate \nHolder (TCH) / declarant of a declaration of design compliance to recommend a schedule for \neach specific type of inspection/check. \nFor an inspection/check with the same periodicity for different TCHs, the content may differ, \nand in some cases may be critically safety-related and may need the use of special tools or \nknowledge and thus would not qualify for Pilot-owner maintenance. Therefore, the \nmaintenance carried out by the Pilot-owner cannot be generalised to specific inspections such \nas 50 Hrs, 100 Hrs or 6 Month periodicity. \nThe Inspections to be carried out are limited to those areas and tasks listed in this AMC to \nAppendix VIII; this allows flexibility in the development of the maintenance programme and \ndoes not limit the inspection to certain specific periodic inspections. A 50 Hrs/6 Month periodic \ninspection for a fixed wing aeroplane as well as the one-year inspection on a glider may normally \nbe eligible for Pilot-owner maintenance. ",

In the case of approved practices and \nprocedures that differ, the statement should refer to them. \n1.1.20. Each maintenance task quoted should be defined in a definition section of the \nprogramme. \n2. Programme basis \n2.1. An owner or a CAMO aircraft maintenance programme should normally be based upon the MRB \nreport, where applicable, and the maintenance planning document or Chapter 5 of the \nmaintenance manual from the TC holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance \n(i.e. the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance programme). \nThe structure and format of these maintenance recommendations may be re-written by the \nowner or the CAMO to better suit the operation and control of the particular maintenance \nprogramme. \n2.2. For a new aircraft where no previously approved maintenance programme exists, it will be \nnecessary for the owner or the CAMO to comprehensively appraise the manufacturer’s \nrecommendations (and the MRB report where applicable), together with other airworthiness \ninformation, in order to produce a realistic programme for approval. \n2.3. For existing aircraft types it is permissible for the owner or CAMO to make comparisons with \nmaintenance programmes previously approved. It should not be assumed that a programme \napproved for one owner or the CAMO would automatically be approved for another. \nEvaluation should be made of the aircraft/fleet utilisation, landing rate, equipment fit and, in \nparticular, the experience of the owner or the CAMO when assessing an existing programme. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 254 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nWhere the competent authority is not satisfied that the proposed maintenance programme can \nbe used as is, the competent authority should request appropriate changes such as additional \nmaintenance tasks or de-escalation of check frequencies as necessary. \n2.4. Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) \nIf CDCCL have been identified for the aircraft type by the TC/STC holder, maintenance \ninstructions should be developed. CDCCL’s are characterised by features in an aircraft \ninstallation or component that should be retained during modification, change, repair, or \nscheduled maintenance for the operational life of the aircraft or applicable component or part. \n3. Amendments \nAmendments (revisions) to the approved maintenance programme should be made by the \nowner or the CAMO, to reflect changes in the recommendations, modifications, service \nexperience of the TC holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance, or as \nrequired by the competent authority. \n4. Permitted variations to maintenance periods \nThe owner or the CAMO may only vary the periods prescribed by the programme with the \napproval of the competent authority or through a procedure developed in the maintenance \nprogramme and approved by the competent authority. \n5. Periodic review of maintenance programme contents \n5.1. The owner- or the CAMO-approved maintenance programmes should be subject to periodic \nreview to ensure that they reflect current recommendations issued by the TC holder or the \ndeclarant of a declaration of design compliance, revisions to the MRB report if applicable, \nmandatory requirements and the maintenance needs of the aircraft. \n5.2. The owner or the CAMO should review the detailed requirements at least annually for \ncontinued validity in the light of operating experience. \n6. Reliability Programmes \n6.1. Applicability \n6.1.1. A reliability programme should be developed in the following cases: \n(a) the aircraft maintenance programme is based upon MSG-3 logic; \n(b) the aircraft maintenance programme includes condition monitored components; \n(c) the aircraft maintenance programme does not contain overhaul time periods for \nall significant system components; \n(d) when specified by the Manufacturer’s maintenance planning document or MRB. \n6.1.2. A reliability Programme need not be developed in the following cases: \n(a) the maintenance programme is based upon the MSG-1 or 2 logic but only contains \nhard time or on condition items; \n(b) the aircraft is not a complex motor-powered aircraft according to Part-M; \n(c) the aircraft maintenance programme provides overhaul time periods for all \nsignificant system components; \n(d) Note: for the purpose of this paragraph, a significant system is a system the failure \nof which could hazard the aircraft safety. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 255 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n6.1.3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 above, a CAMO may however, develop its \nown reliability monitoring programme when it may be deemed beneficial from a \nmaintenance planning point of view. \n6.2. Applicability for CAMO/operator of small fleets of aircraft. \n6.2.1. For the purpose of this paragraph, a small fleet of aircraft is a fleet of less than 6 aircraft \nof the same type. \n6.2.2. The requirement for a reliability programme is irrespective of the CAMO fleet size. \n6.2.3. Complex reliability programmes could be inappropriate for a small fleet. It is \nrecommended that such CAMOs tailor their reliability programmes to suit the size and \ncomplexity of operation. \n6.2.4. One difficulty with a small fleet of aircraft consists in the amount of available data which \ncan be processed: when this amount is too low, the calculation of alert level is very \ncoarse. Therefore ’alert levels‘ should be used carefully. \n6.2.5. A CAMO of a small fleet of aircraft, when establishing a reliability programme, should \nconsider the following: \n(a) The programme should focus on areas where a sufficient amount of data is likely \nto be processed. \n(b) When the amount of available data is very limited, the CAMO engineering \njudgement is then a vital element. In the following examples, careful engineering \nanalysis should be exercised before taking decisions: \n− A ‘0’ rate in the statistical calculation may possibly simply reveal that enough \nstatistical data is missing, rather that there is no potential problem. \n− When alert levels are used, a single event may have the figures reach the \nalert level. Engineering judgement is necessary so as to discriminate an \nartefact from an actual need for a corrective action. \nIn making his engineering judgement, a CAMO is encouraged to establish contact and \nmake comparisons with other CAMOs of the same aircraft, where possible and relevant. \nMaking comparison with data provided by the manufacturer may also be possible. \n6.2.6. In order to obtain accurate reliability data, it should be recommended to pool data and \nanalysis with one or more other CAMO(s). Paragraph 6.6 of this paragraph specifies under \nwhich conditions it is acceptable that CAMOs share reliability data. \n6.2.7. Notwithstanding the above there are cases where the CAMO will be unable to pool data \nwith other CAMO, e.g. at the introduction to service of a new type. In that case the \ncompetent authority should impose additional restrictions on the MRB/MPD tasks \nintervals (e.g. no variations or only minor evolution are possible, and with the competent \nauthority approval). \n6.3. Engineering judgement \n6.3.1. Engineering judgement is itself inherent to reliability programmes as no interpretation of \ndata is possible without judgement. In approving the CAMO maintenance and reliability \nprogrammes, the competent authority is expected to ensure that the organisation which \nruns the programme (it may be CAMO, or an Part-145 organisation under contract) hires \nsufficiently qualified personnel with appropriate engineering experience and \nunderstanding of reliability concept (see AMC M.A.706). ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 256 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n6.3.2. It follows that failure to provide appropriately qualified personnel for the reliability \nprogramme may lead the competent authority to reject the approval of the reliability \nprogramme and therefore the aircraft maintenance programme. \n6.4. Contracted maintenance \n6.4.1. Whereas M.A.302 specifies that, the aircraft maintenance programme -which includes \nthe associated reliability programme-, should be managed and presented by the CAMO \nto the competent authority, the CAMO may subcontract certain functions to the \nmaintenance organisation under contract, provided this organisation proves to have the \nappropriate expertise. \n6.4.2. These functions are: \n(a) Developing the aircraft maintenance and reliability programmes, \n(b) Performing the collection and analysis of the reliability data, \n(c) Providing reliability reports, and \n(d) Proposing corrective actions to the CAMO. \n6.4.3. Notwithstanding the above decision to implement a corrective action (or the decision to \nrequest from the competent authority the approval to implement a corrective action) \nremains the CAMO prerogative and responsibility. In relation to paragraph 6.4.2(d) \nabove, a decision not to implement a corrective action should be justified and \ndocumented. \n6.4.4. The arrangement between the CAMO and the maintenance organisation should be \nspecified in the maintenance contract (see Appendix XI to AMC M.A.708(c)) and the \nrelevant CAME, and maintenance organisation procedures. \n6.5. Reliability programme \nIn preparing the programme details, account should be taken of this paragraph. All associated \nprocedures should be clearly defined. \n6.5.1. Objectives \n6.5.1.1. A statement should be included summarising as precisely as possible the prime \nobjectives of the programme. To the minimum it should include the following: \n(a) to recognise the need for corrective action, \n(b) to establish what corrective action is needed and, \n(c) to determine the effectiveness of that action. \n6.5.1.2. The extent of the objectives should be directly related to the scope of the \nprogramme. Its scope could vary from a component defect monitoring system for \na small CAMO, to an integrated maintenance management programme for a big \nCAMO. The manufacturer’s maintenance planning documents may give guidance \non the objectives and should be consulted in every case. \n6.5.1.3. In case of a MSG-3 based maintenance programme, the reliability programme \nshould provide a monitor that all MSG-3 related tasks from the maintenance \nprogramme are effective and their periodicity is adequate.

Identification of items. \nThe items controlled by the programme should be stated, e.g. by ATA Chapters. Where \nsome items (e.g. aircraft structure, engines, APU) are controlled by separate \nprogrammes, the associated procedures (e.g. individual sampling or life development \nprogrammes, constructor’s structure sampling programmes) should be cross referenced \nin the programme. \n6.5.3. Terms and definitions. \nThe significant terms and definitions applicable to the Programme should be clearly \nidentified. Terms are already defined in MSG-3, Part-145 and Part-M. \n6.5.4. Information sources and collection. \n6.5.4.1. Sources of information should be listed and procedures for the transmission of \ninformation from the sources, together with the procedure for collecting and \nreceiving it, should be set out in detail in the CAME or MOE as appropriate. \n6.5.4.2. The type of information to be collected should be related to the objectives of the \nProgramme and should be such that it enables both an overall broad based \nassessment of the information to be made and also allow for assessments to be \nmade as to whether any reaction, both to trends and to individual events, is \nnecessary. The following are examples of the normal prime sources: \n(a) Pilots Reports. \n(b) Technical Logs. \n(c) Aircraft Maintenance Access Terminal / On-board Maintenance System \nreadouts. \n(d) Maintenance Worksheets. \n(e) Workshop Reports. \n(f) Reports on Functional Checks. \n(g) Reports on Special Inspections. \n(h) Stores Issues/Reports. \n(i) Air Safety Reports. \n(j) Reports on Technical Delays and Incidents. \n(k) Other sources: ETOPS, RVSM, CAT II/III. \n6.5.4.3. In addition to the normal primary sources of information, due account should be \ntaken of continuing airworthiness and safety information promulgated under Part \n21 or Part 21 Light. \n6.5.5. Display of information. \nCollected information may be displayed graphically or in a tabular format or a \ncombination of both. The rules governing any separation or discarding of information \nprior to incorporation into these formats should be stated. The format should be such \nthat the identification of trends, specific highlights and related events would be readily \napparent. \n6.5.5.1. The above display of information should include provisions for ‘nil returns’ to aid \nthe examination of the total information. ",

Where ‘standards’ or ‘alert levels’ are included in the programme, the display of \ninformation should be oriented accordingly. \n6.5.6. Examination, analysis and interpretation of the information. \nThe method employed for examining, analysing and interpreting the programme \ninformation should be explained. \n6.5.6.1. Examination. \nMethods of examination of information may be varied according to the content \nand quantity of information of individual programmes. These can range from \nexamination of the initial indication of performance variations to formalised \ndetailed procedures at specific periods, and the methods should be fully described \nin the programme documentation. \n6.5.6.2. Analysis and Interpretation. \nThe procedures for analysis and interpretation of information should be such as to \nenable the performance of the items controlled by the programme to be \nmeasured; they should also facilitate recognition, diagnosis and recording of \nsignificant problems. The whole process should be such as to enable a critical \nassessment to be made of the effectiveness of the programme as a total activity. \nSuch a process may involve: \n(a) Comparisons of operational reliability with established or allocated \nstandards (in the initial period these could be obtained from in-service \nexperience of similar equipment of aircraft types). \n(b) Analysis and interpretation of trends. \n(c) The evaluation of repetitive defects. \n(d) Confidence testing of expected and achieved results. \n(e) Studies of life-bands and survival characteristics. \n(f) Reliability predictions. \n(g) Other methods of assessment. \n6.5.6.3. The range and depth of engineering analysis and interpretation should be related \nto the particular programme and to the facilities available. The following, at least, \nshould be taken into account: \n(a) Flight defects and reductions in operational reliability. \n(b) Defects occurring on-line and at main base. \n(c) Deterioration observed during routine maintenance. \n(d) Workshop and overhaul facility findings. \n(e) Modification evaluations. \n(f) Sampling programmes. \n(g) The adequacy of maintenance equipment and publications. \n(h) The effectiveness of maintenance procedures. \n(i) Staff training.

Where the CAMO relies upon contracted maintenance and/or overhaul facilities \nas an information input to the programme, the arrangements for availability and \ncontinuity of such information should be established and details should be \nincluded. \n6.5.7. Corrective Actions. \n6.5.7.1. The procedures and time scales both for implementing corrective actions and for \nmonitoring the effects of corrective actions should be fully described. Corrective \nactions shall correct any reduction in reliability revealed by the programme and \ncould take the form of: \n(a) Changes to maintenance, operational procedures or techniques. \n(b) Maintenance changes involving inspection frequency and content, function \nchecks, overhaul requirements and time limits, which will require \namendment of the scheduled maintenance periods or tasks in the approved \nmaintenance programme. This may include escalation or de-escalation of \ntasks, addition, modification or deletion of tasks. \n(c) Amendments to approved manuals (e.g. maintenance manual, crew \nmanual). \n(d) Initiation of modifications. \n(e) Special inspections of fleet campaigns. \n(f) Spares provisioning. \n(g) Staff training. \n(h) Manpower and equipment planning. \nNote: Some of the above corrective actions may need the competent authority’s \napproval before implementation. \n6.5.7.2. The procedures for effecting changes to the maintenance programme should be \ndescribed, and the associated documentation should include a planned completion \ndate for each corrective action, where applicable. \n6.5.8. Organisational Responsibilities. \nThe organisational structure and the department responsible for the administration of \nthe programme should be stated. The chains of responsibility for individuals and \ndepartments (Engineering, Production, Quality, Operations etc.) in respect of the \nprogramme, together with the information and functions of any programme control \ncommittees (reliability group), should be defined. Participation of the competent \nauthority should be stated. This information should be contained in the CAME as \nappropriate. \n6.5.9. Presentation of information to the competent authority. \nThe following information should be submitted to the competent authority for approval \nas part of the reliability programme: \n(a) The format and content of routine reports. \n(b) The time scales for the production of reports together with their distribution.

These reports should contain sufficient detailed \ninformation to enable the competent authority to make its own evaluation where \nnecessary. \n6.5.10. Evaluation and review. \nEach programme should describe the procedures and individual responsibilities in \nrespect of continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of the programme as a whole. The \ntime periods and the procedures for both routine and non-routine reviews of \nmaintenance control should be detailed (progressive, monthly, quarterly, or annual \nreviews, procedures following reliability ‘standards’ or ‘alert levels’ being exceeded, etc.). \n6.5.10.1. Each Programme should contain procedures for monitoring and, as necessary, \nrevising the reliability ‘standards’ or ‘alert levels’. The organisational \nresponsibilities for monitoring and revising the ‘standards’ should be specified \ntogether with associated time scales. \n6.5.10.2. Although not exclusive, the following list gives guidance on the criteria to be \ntaken into account during the review. \n(a) Utilisation (high/low/seasonal). \n(b) Fleet commonality. \n(c) Alert Level adjustment criteria. \n(d) Adequacy of data. \n(e) Reliability procedure audit. \n(f) Staff training. \n(g) Operational and maintenance procedures. \n6.5.11. Approval of maintenance programme amendment \nThe competent authority may authorise the CAMO to implement in the maintenance \nprogramme changes arising from the reliability programme results prior to their formal \napproval by the authority when satisfied that; \n(a) the Reliability Programme monitors the content of the Maintenance Programme \nin a comprehensive manner, and \n(b) the procedures associated with the functioning of the ‘Reliability Group’ provide \nthe assurance that appropriate control is exercised by the CAMO over the internal \nvalidation of such changes. \n6.6. Pooling Arrangements. \n6.6.1. In some cases, in order that sufficient data may be analysed it may be desirable to ‘pool’ \ndata: i.e. collate data from a number of CAMOs of the same type of aircraft. For the \nanalysis to be valid, the aircraft concerned, mode of operation, and maintenance \nprocedures applied should be substantially the same: variations in utilisation between \ntwo CAMOs may, more than anything, fundamentally corrupt the analysis. Although not \nexhaustive, the following list gives guidance on the primary factors which need to be \ntaken into account. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 261 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(a) Certification factors, such as: aircraft TCDS compliance (variant)/modification \nstatus, including SB compliance. \n(b) Operational Factors, such as: operational environment/utilisation, e.g. \nlow/high/seasonal, etc./respective fleet size operating rules applicable (e.g. \nETOPS/RVSM/All Weather etc.)/operating procedures/MEL and MEL utilisation. \n(c) Maintenance factors, such as: aircraft age maintenance procedures; maintenance \nstandards applicable; lubrication procedures and programme; MPD revision or \nescalation applied or maintenance programme applicable \n6.6.2. Although it may not be necessary for all of the foregoing to be completely common, it is \nnecessary for a substantial amount of commonality to prevail. Decision should be taken \nby the competent authority on a case by case basis. \n6.6.3. In case of a short term lease agreement (less than 6 month) more flexibility against the \npara 6.6.1 criteria may be granted by the competent authority, so as to allow the \nowner/CAMO to operate the aircraft under the same programme during the lease \nagreement effectivity. \n6.6.4. Changes by any one of the CAMO to the above, requires assessment in order that the \npooling benefits can be maintained. Where a CAMO wishes to pool data in this way, the \napproval of the competent authority should be sought prior to any formal agreement \nbeing signed between CAMOs. \n6.6.5. Whereas this paragraph 6.6 is intended to address the pooling of data directly between \nCAMOs, it is acceptable that the CAMO participates in a reliability programme managed \nby the aircraft manufacturer, when the competent authority is satisfied that the \nmanufacturer manages a reliability programme which complies with the intent of this \nparagraph.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 262 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAppendix II to AMC M.A.711(a)(3) — Subcontracting of continuing \nairworthiness management tasks \nED Decision 2021/009/R \n1. Subcontracted continuing airworthiness management tasks \n1.1. To actively control the standards of the subcontracted organisation, the CAMO should employ \na person or group of persons who are trained and competent in the disciplines associated with \nM.A. Subpart G. As such, they are responsible for determining what maintenance is required, \nwhen it has to be performed, by whom and to what standard in order to ensure the continuing \nairworthiness of the aircraft to be operated. \n1.2. The CAMO should conduct a pre-subcontract audit to establish that the organisation to be \nsubcontracted can achieve the standards required by M.A. Subpart G in connection with those \nactivities to be subcontracted. \n1.3. The CAMO should ensure that the organisation to be subcontracted has sufficient and qualified \npersonnel who are trained and competent in the functions to be sub-contracted. In assessing \nthe adequacy of personnel resources, the CAMO should consider the particular needs of those \nactivities that are to be subcontracted, while taking into account the subcontracted \norganisations existing commitments. \n1.4. To be appropriately approved to subcontract continuing airworthiness management tasks, the \nCAMO should have procedures for the management control of these arrangements. The \ncontinuing airworthiness management exposition should contain relevant procedures to reflect \nits control of those arrangements made with the sub-contracted organisation. \n1.5. Subcontracted continuing airworthiness management tasks should be addressed in a contract \nbetween the CAMO and the subcontracted organisation. The contract should also specify that \nthe subcontracted organisation is responsible for informing the CAMO, that is in turn \nresponsible for notifying the respective competent authority, of any subsequent changes that \naffect their ability to fulfil the contract. \n1.6. The subcontracted organisation should use procedures which set out the manner of fulfilling its \nresponsibilities with regard to the subcontracted activities. Such procedures may be developed \nby either the subcontracted organisation or the CAMO. \n1.7. Where the subcontracted organisation develops its own procedures, they should be compatible \nwith the continuing airworthiness management exposition and the terms of the contract. These \nshould be accepted by the competent authority as extended procedures of the CAMO and as \nsuch should be cross-referenced from the continuing airworthiness management exposition. \nOne current copy of the subcontracted organisation’s relevant procedures should be kept by \nthe CAMO and should be accessible to the competent authority when needed. \nNote: Should any conflict arise between the subcontracted organisation’s procedures and those \nof the CAMO, then the policy and procedures of the continuing airworthiness \nmanagement exposition will prevail. \n1.8. The contract should also specify that the subcontracted organisation’s procedures may only be \namended with the agreement of the CAMO. The CAMO should ensure that these amendments \nare compatible with its continuing airworthiness management exposition and comply with M.A. \nSubpart G. \nThe CAMO should nominate the person responsible for continued monitoring and acceptance \nof the subcontracted organisation’s procedures and their amendments. The controls used to ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 263 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nfulfil this function should be clearly set out in the amendment section of the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition detailing the level of CAMO involvement. \n1.9. Whenever any elements of the continuing airworthiness management tasks are subcontracted, \nthe CAMO personnel should have access to all relevant data in order to fulfil their \nresponsibilities. \nNote: The CAMO retains the authority to override, whenever necessary for the continuing \nairworthiness of their aircraft, any recommendation of the subcontracted organisation. \n1.10. The CAMO should ensure that the subcontracted organisation continues to have qualified \ntechnical expertise and sufficient resources to perform the sub-contracted tasks while \ncomplying with the relevant procedures. Failure to do so may invalidate the CAMO approval. \n1.11. The contract should provide for competent authority monitoring. \n1.12. The contract should address the respective responsibilities to ensure that any findings arising \nfrom the competent authority monitoring will be closed to the satisfaction of the competent \nauthority. \n2. Accomplishment \nThis paragraph describes the topics which may be applicable to such subcontracting \narrangements. \n2.1. Scope of work \nThe type of aircraft and their registrations, engine types and/or components subject to the \ncontinuing airworthiness management tasks contract should be specified. \n2.2. Maintenance programme development and amendment \nThe CAMO may subcontract the preparation of the draft maintenance programme and any \nsubsequent amendments. However, the CAMO remains responsible for assessing that the draft \nproposals meet its needs and for obtaining competent authority approval; the relevant \nprocedures should specify these responsibilities. The contract should also stipulate that any \ndata necessary to substantiate the approval of the initial programme or an amendment to this \nprogramme should be provided for CAMO agreement and/or competent authority upon \nrequest. \n2.3. Maintenance programme effectiveness and reliability \nThe CAMO should have a system in place to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the \nmaintenance programme based on maintenance and operational experience. The collection of \ndata and initial assessment may be made by the subcontracted organisation; the required \nactions are to be endorsed by the CAMO. \nWhere reliability monitoring is used to establish the effectiveness of the maintenance \nprogramme, this may be provided by the subcontracted organisation and should be specified in \nthe relevant procedures. Reference should be made to the approved maintenance and \nreliability programme. Participation of the CAMO’s personnel in reliability meetings with the \nsubcontracted organisation should also be specified. \nWhen providing reliability data, the subcontracted organisation is limited to working with \nprimary data/documents provided by the CAMO or data provided by the CAMO’s contracted \nmaintenance organisation(s) from which the reports are derived. The pooling of reliability data \nis permitted if it is acceptable to the competent authority. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 264 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n2.4. Permitted variations to the maintenance programme \nThe reasons and justification for any proposed variation to scheduled maintenance may be \nprepared by the subcontracted organisation. Acceptance of the proposed variation should be \ngranted by the CAMO. The means by which the CAMO acceptance is given should be specified \nin the relevant procedures. When outside the limits set out in the maintenance programme, the \nCAMO is required to obtain approval by the competent authority. \n2.5. Scheduled maintenance \nWhere the subcontracted organisation plans and defines maintenance checks or inspections in \naccordance with the approved maintenance programme, the required liaison with the CAMO, \nincluding feedback, should be defined. \nThe planning control and documentation should be specified in the appropriate supporting \nprocedures. These procedures should typically set out the CAMO’s level of involvement in each \ntype of check. This will normally involve the CAMO assessing and agreeing to a work \nspecification on a case-by-case basis for base maintenance checks. For routine line maintenance \nchecks, this may be controlled on a day-to-day basis by the subcontracted organisation subject \nto appropriate liaison and CAMO controls to ensure timely compliance. This may typically \ninclude but is not necessarily limited to: \n− applicable work package, including job cards; \n− scheduled component removal list; \n− ADs to be incorporated; \n− modifications to be incorporated. \nThe associated procedures should ensure that the CAMO is informed in a timely manner on the \naccomplishment of such tasks. \n2.6. Quality monitoring \nThe CAMO’s quality system should monitor the adequacy of the subcontracted continuing \nairworthiness management task performance for compliance with the contract and with M.A. \nSubpart G. The terms of the contract should therefore include a provision allowing the CAMO \nto perform a quality surveillance (including audits) of the subcontracted organisation. The aim \nof the surveillance is primarily to investigate and judge the effectiveness of those subcontracted \nactivities and thereby to ensure compliance with M.A Subpart G and the contract. Audit reports \nmay be subject to review when requested by the competent authority. \n2.7. Access to the competent authority \nThe contract should specify that the subcontracted organisation should always grant access to \nthe competent authority. \n2.8. Maintenance data \nThe maintenance data used for the purpose of the contract should be specified, together with \nthose responsible for providing such documentation and the competent authority responsible \nfor the acceptance/approval of such data, when applicable. The CAMO should ensure that such \ndata, including revisions, is readily available to the CAMO personnel and to those in the \nsubcontracted organisation who may be required to assess such data. The CAMO should \nestablish a ‘fast track’ means to ensure that urgent data is transmitted to the subcontractor in \na timely manner. Maintenance data is defined in M.A.401(b) or ML.A.401(b). \n2.9. Airworthiness directives (ADs) ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 265 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nWhile the various aspects of AD assessment, planning and follow-up may be accomplished by \nthe subcontracted organisation, AD embodiment is performed by a maintenance organisation. \nThe CAMO is responsible for ensuring timely embodiment of the applicable ADs and is to be \nprovided with notification of compliance. It, therefore, follows that the CAMO should have clear \npolicies and procedures on AD embodiment supported by defined procedures which will ensure \nthat the CAMO agrees to the proposed means of compliance. \nThe relevant procedures should specify: \n− what information (e.g. AD publications, continuing airworthiness records, flight \nhours/cycles, etc.) the subcontracted organisation needs from the CAMO; \n− what information (e.g. AD planning listing, detailed engineering order, etc.) the CAMO \nneeds from the subcontracted organisation in order to ensure timely compliance with the \nADs. \nTo fulfil the above responsibility, the CAMO should ensure that it receives current mandatory \ncontinued airworthiness information for the aircraft and equipment it is managing. \n2.10. Service bulletin (SB) modifications \nThe subcontracted organisation may be required to review and make recommendations on the \nembodiment of an SB and other associated non-mandatory material based on a clear policy \nestablished by the CAMO. This should be specified in the contract. \n2.11. Mandatory life limitation or scheduled maintenance controls and component control/removal \nforecast \nWhere the subcontracted organisation performs planning activities, it should be specified that \nthe organisation should receive the current flight cycles, flight hours, landings and/or calendar \ncontrolled details, as applicable, at a frequency to be specified in the contract. The frequency \nshould be such that it allows the organisation to properly perform the subcontracted planning \nfunctions. It, therefore, follows that there will need to be adequate liaison between the CAMO, \nthe contracted maintenance organisation(s) and the subcontracted organisation. Additionally, \nthe contract should specify how the CAMO will be in possession of all current flight cycles, flight \nhours, etc., so that it may assure the timely accomplishment of the required maintenance. \n2.12. Engine health monitoring \nIf the CAMO subcontracts the on-wing engine health monitoring, the subcontracted \norganisation should receive all the relevant information to perform this task, including any \nparameter reading deemed necessary to be supplied by the CAMO for this control. The contract \nshould also specify what kind of feedback information (such as engine limitation, appropriate \ntechnical advice, etc.) the organisation should provide to the CAMO. \n2.13. Defect control \nWhere the CAMO has subcontracted the day-to-day control of technical log deferred defects, \nthis should be specified in the contract and should be adequately described in the appropriate \nprocedures. The operator’s MEL/CDL provides the basis for establishing which defects may be \ndeferred and the associated limits. The procedures should also define the responsibilities and \nactions to be taken for defects such as AOG situations, repetitive defects, and damage beyond \nthe type certificate holder’s limits. \nFor all other defects identified during maintenance, the information should be brought to the \nattention of the CAMO which, depending upon the procedural authority granted by the \ncompetent authority, may determine that some defects can be deferred. Therefore, adequate ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 266 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nliaison between the CAMO, its subcontracted organisation and contracted maintenance \norganisation should be ensured. \nThe subcontracted organisation should make a positive assessment of potential deferred \ndefects and consider the potential hazards arising from the cumulative effect of any \ncombination of defects. The subcontracted organisations should liaise with the CAMO to get its \nagreement following this assessment. \nDeferment of MEL/CDL allowable defects can be accomplished by a contracted maintenance \norganisation in compliance with the relevant technical log procedures, subject to the \nacceptance by the aircraft commander. \n2.14. Mandatory occurrence reporting \nAll incidents and occurrences that meet the reporting criteria defined in Part-M and Part-145 \nshould be reported as required by the respective requirements. The CAMO should ensure that \nadequate liaison exists with the subcontracted organisation and the maintenance organisation. \n2.15. Continuing airworthiness records \nThey may be maintained and kept by the subcontracted organisation on behalf of the CAMO, \nwhich remains the owner of these documents. However, the CAMO should be provided with \nthe current status of AD compliance and life-limited parts and time-controlled components in \naccordance with the agreed procedures. The CAMO should also be granted unrestricted and \ntimely access to the original records as and when needed. Online access to the appropriate \ninformation systems is acceptable. \nThe record-keeping requirements of Part-M should be met. Access to the records by duly \nauthorised members of the competent authority should be granted upon request. \n2.16. Maintenance check flight (MCF) procedures \nMCFs are performed under the control of the operator in coordination with the CAMO. MCF \nrequirements from the subcontracted organisation or contracted maintenance organisation \nshould be agreed by the operator/CAMO. \n2.17. Communication between the CAMO and the subcontracted organisation \n2.17.1. In order to fulfil its airworthiness responsibility, the CAMO needs to receive all the \nrelevant reports and relevant maintenance data. The contract should specify what \ninformation should be provided and when. \n2.17.2. Meetings provide one important cornerstone whereby the CAMO can fulfil part of its \nresponsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of the operated aircraft. They should be used \nto establish good communication between the CAMO, the subcontracted organisation \nand the contracted maintenance organisation. The terms of the contract should include, \nwhenever appropriate, the provision for a certain number of meetings to be held \nbetween the involved parties. Details of the types of liaison meetings and associated \nterms of reference of each meeting should be documented. The meetings may include \nbut are not limited to all or a combination of: \n(a) Contract review \nBefore the contract is enforced, it is very important that the technical personnel of \nboth parties, that are involved in the fulfilment of the contract, meet in order to \nbe sure that every point leads to a common understanding of the duties of both \nparties.

Refer to KRE C.1 ‘Aircraft Maintenance Programme’. \nComponents with a mandatory life limitation must be permanently \nremoved from service when, or before, their operating limitation is \nexceeded. The life limitation is controlled at the component level (in \nopposition to aircraft level). \nComponents which are ‘time-controlled components’ include the \nfollowing: \n− components for which removal and restoration are scheduled, \nregardless of their level of failure resistance. Reference is made to \nhard time components: They are subject to periodic maintenance \ndealing with a deterioration that is assumed to be predictable (the \noverall reliability invariably decreases with age): Failure is less \nlikely to occur before restoration is necessary; \n− components for which failure resistance can reduce and drop \nbelow a defined level: Inspections are scheduled to detect \npotential failures. Reference is made to ‘On-condition’ \ncomponents: They are called such because components, which are \ninspected, are left in service (no further maintenance action taken) \non the condition that they continue to meet specified \nperformance standards. \nNotes: \n1. Restoration tasks for hard time components are not the same as \n‘On-condition’ tasks, since they do not monitor gradual \ndeterioration, but are primarily done to ensure the item may \ncontinue to remain in service until the next planned restoration. \n1. Check that the mandatory maintenance tasks are identified as such and managed \nseparately from recommendations. \n2. Sample check installed components (PN and SN) against aircraft records: \na. Correct Part Number and Serial Number installed. \nb. Correct authorised release document available. \n3. Check the current status of time-controlled components, with due consideration to \ndeferred items. They must identify: \na. The affected components (Part Number and Serial Number). \nb. For components subject to a repetitive task: the task description and reference, \nthe applicable threshold/interval, the last accomplishment data (date, the \ncomponent’s total accumulated life in Hours, Cycles, Landings, Calendar time, as \nnecessary) and the next planned accomplishment data. \nc. For components subject to an unscheduled task: the task description and \nreference, the accomplishment data (date, the component’s total accumulated \nlife in Hours, Cycles, Landings, Calendar time, as necessary). Pay attention to \nETOPS and CDCCL components. \n4. Check current status of life-limited parts. This status can be requested upon each \ntransfer throughout the operating life of the part: \na. The life limitation, the component’s total accumulated life, and the life remaining \nbefore the component’s life limitation is reached (indicating Hours, Cycles, \nLandings, Calendar time, as necessary). \nb. If relevant for the determination of the remaining life, a full installation history \nindicating the number of hours, cycles or calendar time relevant to each \ninstallation on these different types of aircraft/engine.

For larger \norganisations, the principles and practices of an independent quality system should be used. \nDepending on the complexity of the small organisation (number and type of aircraft, number of \ndifferent fleets, subcontracting of specialised services, etc.), the organisational review system may \nvary from a system using the principles and practices of a quality system (except for the requirement \nof independence) to a simplified system adapted to the low complexity of the organisation and the \naircraft managed. \nAs a core minimum, the organisational review system should have the following features, which \nshould be described in the Maintenance Organisation Manual (MOM): \na. Identification of the person responsible for the organisational review programme. \nBy default, this person should be the accountable manager, unless he delegates this \nresponsibility to (one of) the M.A.606(b) person(s). \nb. Identification and qualification criteria for the person(s) responsible for performing the \norganisational reviews. \nThese persons should have a thorough knowledge of the regulations and of the maintenance \norganisation procedures. They should also have knowledge of audits, acquired through training \nor through experience (preferably as an auditor, but also possibly because they actively \nparticipated in several audits conducted by the competent authority). \nc. Elaboration of the organisational review programme: \n− Checklist(s) covering all items necessary to be satisfied that the organisation delivers a \nsafe product and complies with the regulation. All procedures described in the MOM \nshould be addressed. \n− A schedule for the accomplishment of the checklist items. Each item should be checked \nat least every 12 months. The organisation may choose to conduct one full review \nannually or to conduct several partial reviews. \nd. Performance of organisational reviews \nEach checklist item should be answered using an appropriate combination of: \n− review of records, documentation, etc; \n− sample check of aircraft under contract or being maintained under a work order; \n− interview of personnel involved; \n− review of discrepancies and difficulty internal reports (e.g. notified difficulties in using \ncurrent procedures and tools, systematic deviations from procedures, etc.); \n− review of complaints filed by customers after delivery. \ne. Management of findings and occurrence reports. \n− All findings should be recorded and notified to the affected persons. \n− All level 1 findings, in the sense of M.A.619(a), should be immediately notified to the \ncompetent authority and all necessary actions on aircraft in service should be \nimmediately taken. ",
    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC AND GM TO \nANNEX I (Part-M)  Page 325 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− All occurrence reports should be reviewed with the aim for continuous improvement of \nthe system by identifying possible corrective and preventive actions. This should be done \nin order to find prior indicators (e.g., notified difficulties in using current procedures and \ntools, systematic deviations from procedures, unsafe behaviours, etc.), and dismissed \nalerts that, had they been recognised and appropriately managed before the event, could \nhave resulted in the undesired event being prevented. \n− Corrective and preventive actions should be approved by the person responsible for the \norganisational review programme and implemented within a specified time frame. \n− Once the person responsible for the organisational review programme is satisfied that \nthe corrective action is effective, closure of the finding should be recorded along with a \nsummary of the corrective action. \n− The accountable manager should be notified of all significant findings and, on a regular \nbasis, of the global results of the organisational review programme. \nFollowing is a typical example of a simplified organisational review checklist, to be adapted as \nnecessary to cover the MOM procedures: \n1 – Scope of work \nCheck that: \n− All aircraft and components under maintenance or under contract are covered in EASA \nForm 3. \n− The scope of work in the MOM does not disagree with EASA Form 3. \n− No work has been performed outside the scope of EASA Form 3 and the MOM. \n2 – Maintenance data \n− Check that maintenance data to cover the aircraft in the scope of work of the MOM are \npresent and up-to-date. \n− Check that no change has been made to the maintenance data from the TC holder \nwithout being notified. \n3 – Equipment and Tools \n− Check the equipment and tools against the lists in the MOM and check if still appropriate \nto the TC holder’s instructions. \n− Check tools for proper calibration (sample check). \n4 – Stores \n− Do the stores meet the criteria in the procedures of the MOM? \n− Check by sampling some items in the store for presence of proper documentation and \nany overdue items. \n5 – Certification of maintenance and airworthiness review \n− Has maintenance on products and components been properly certified? \n− Have implementation of modifications/repairs been carried out with appropriate \napproval of such modifications/repairs (sample check)? \n− Have airworthiness reviews been properly performed and the airworthiness review \ncertificate properly been issued?

Maintenance contracts \nThe following paragraphs are not intended to provide a standard maintenance contract, but to \nprovide a list of the main points that should be addressed, when applicable, in a maintenance \ncontract between the CAMO managing aircraft subject to Part-M and a maintenance \norganization approved in accordance with Part-145 or Subpart F of Part M. The following \nparagraphs only address technical matters and exclude matters such as costs, delay, warranty, \netc. \nWhen maintenance is contracted to more than one maintenance organisation (for example, \naircraft base maintenance to X, engine maintenance to Y, and line maintenance to Z1, Z2 and \nZ3), attention should be paid to the consistency of the different maintenance contracts. \nA maintenance contract is not normally intended to provide appropriate detailed work \ninstructions to personnel. Accordingly, there should be established organisational \nresponsibilities, procedures and routines in the CAMO and the maintenance organisation to \ncover these functions in a satisfactory way such that any person involved is informed about \nhis/her responsibilities and the procedures that apply. These procedures and routines can be \nincluded/appended to the CAME and to the maintenance organisation’s manual/MOE, or can \nconsist in separate procedures. In other words, procedures and routines should reflect the \nconditions of the contract. \n2. Aircraft/engine maintenance \nThe following subparagraphs may be adapted to a maintenance contract that applies to aircraft \nbase maintenance, aircraft line maintenance, and engine maintenance. \nAircraft maintenance also includes the maintenance of the engines and APU while they are \ninstalled on the aircraft. \n2.1. Scope of work \nThe type of maintenance to be performed by the maintenance organisation should be specified \nunambiguously. In case of line and/or base maintenance, the contract should specify the aircraft \ntype and, preferably, should include the aircraft’s registrations. \nIn case of engine maintenance, the contract should specify the engine type. \n2.2. Locations identified for the performance of maintenance/certificates held \nThe place(s) where base, line or engine maintenance, as applicable, will be performed should \nbe specified. The certificate held by the maintenance organisation at the place(s) where \nmaintenance will be performed should be referred to in the contract. If necessary, the contract \nmay address the possibility of performing maintenance at any location subject to the need for \nsuch maintenance arising either from the unserviceability of the aircraft or from the necessity \nto support occasional line maintenance. \n2.3. Subcontracting \nThe maintenance contract should specify under which conditions the maintenance organisation \nmay subcontract tasks to a third party (regardless if this third party is approved or not). At least \nthe contract should make reference to M.A.615 and 145.A.75. Additional guidance is provided \nby the associated AMC/GM. In addition, the CAMO may require the maintenance organisation \nto obtain the CAMO approval before subcontracting to a third party. Access should be given to \nthe CAMO to any information (especially the quality monitoring information) about the ",

Identification of the person responsible for the organisational review programme: \nBy default, this person should be the accountable manager, unless he delegates this \nresponsibility to (one of) the M.A.706(c) person(s). \nb. Identification and qualification criteria for the person(s) responsible for performing the \norganisational reviews: \nThese persons should have a thorough knowledge of the regulations and of the continuing \nairworthiness management organisation (CAMO) procedures. They should also have knowledge \nof audits, acquired through training or through experience (preferably as an auditor, but also \npossibly because they actively participated in several audits conducted by the competent \nauthority). \nc. Elaboration of the organisational review programme: \n− Checklist(s) covering all items necessary to be satisfied that the organisation delivers a \nsafe product and complies with the regulation. All procedures described in the CAME \nshould be addressed. \n− A schedule for the accomplishment of the checklist items. Each item should be checked \nat least every 12 months. The organisation may choose to conduct one full review \nannually or to conduct several partial reviews. \nd. Performance of organisational reviews: \nEach checklist item should be answered using an appropriate combination of: \n− review of records, documentation, etc. \n− sample check of aircraft under contract. \n− interview of personnel involved. \n− review of discrepancies and difficulty internal reports (e.g., notified difficulties in using \ncurrent procedures and tools, systematic deviations from procedures, etc.). \n− review of complaints filed by customers.

Management of findings and occurrence reports: \n− All findings should be recorded and notified to the affected persons. \n− All level 1 findings, in the sense of M.A.716(a), should be immediately notified to the \ncompetent authority and all necessary actions on aircraft in service should be \nimmediately taken. \n− All occurrence reports should be reviewed with the aim for continuous improvement of \nthe system by identifying possible corrective and preventive actions. This should be done \nin order to find prior indicators (e.g., notified difficulties in using current procedures and \ntools, systematic deviations from procedures, unsafe behaviours, etc.), and dismissed \nalerts that, had they been recognised and appropriately managed before the event, could \nhave resulted in the undesired event being prevented. \n− Corrective and preventive actions should be approved by the person responsible for the \norganisational review programme and implemented within a specified time frame. \n− Once the person responsible for the organisational review programme is satisfied that \nthe corrective action is effective, closure of the finding should be recorded along with a \nsummary of the corrective action. \n− The accountable manager should be notified of all significant findings and, on a regular \nbasis, of the global results of the organisational review programme. \nFollowing is a typical example of a simplified organisational review checklist, to be adapted as \nnecessary to cover the CAME procedures: \n1 – Scope of work \n− All aircraft under contract are covered in the Form 14. \n− The scope of work in the CAME does not disagree with the Form 14. \n− No work has been performed outside the scope of the Form 14 and the CAME. \n− Is it justified to retain in the approved scope of work aircraft types for which the \norganisation has no longer aircraft under contract? \n2 – Airworthiness situation of the fleet \n− Does the continuing airworthiness status (AD, maintenance programme, life limited \ncomponents, deferred maintenance, ARC validity) show any expired items? If so, are the \naircraft grounded? \n3 – Aircraft maintenance programme \n− Check that all revisions to the TC/STC holders Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness, \nsince the last review, have been (or are planned to be) incorporated in the maintenance \nprogramme, unless otherwise approved by the Competent Authority. \n− Has the maintenance programme been revised to take into account all modifications or \nrepairs impacting the maintenance programme? \n− Have all maintenance programme amendments been approved at the right level \n(competent authority or indirect approval)? \n− Does the status of compliance with the maintenance programme reflect the latest \napproved maintenance programme?

The main objective of the assessment is to identify the \nstrengths and weaknesses to drive continual improvement. \nRemark: For ‘risk assessment’, please refer to the definition below. \nBase \nmaintenance \nRef. AMC1 145.A.10 \nBase \nmaintenance \nhangar \nrefers to a closed facility that can house an aircraft and protect it from environmental \nconditions. \nCompetency \nis a combination of individual skills, practical and theoretical knowledge, attitude, \ntraining, and experience. \nCorrection \nis the action to eliminate a detected non-compliance. \nCorrective action \nis the action to eliminate or mitigate the root cause(s) and prevent the recurrence of an \nexisting detected non-compliance, or other undesirable conditions or situations. Proper \ndetermination of the root cause(s) is crucial for defining effective corrective actions to \nprevent reoccurrence. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nGENERAL  Page 343 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nError \nis an action or inaction by a person that may lead to deviations from accepted procedures \nor regulations. \nNote: Errors are often associated with occasions when a planned sequence of mental or \nphysical activities either fails to achieve its intended outcome, or is not appropriate with \nregard to the intended outcome, and when results cannot be attributed purely to chance. \nFatigue \nis a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting \nfrom sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload (mental and/or \nphysical activity) that can impair a person’s alertness and ability to safely perform his or \nher tasks. \nHazard \nis a condition or an object with the potential to cause or contribute to an aircraft incident \nor accident. \nHuman factors is anything that affects human performance, which means principles that apply to \naeronautical activities, and which seek safe interface between the human and other \nsystem components by proper consideration of human performance. \nHuman \nperformance \nrefers to human capabilities and limitations which have an impact on the safety and \nefficiency of aeronautical activities. \nInspection in the context of compliance monitoring and oversight, refers to an independent \ndocumented conformity evaluation by observation and judgement accompanied, as \nappropriate, by measurement, testing or gauging, in order to verify compliance with \napplicable requirements. \nNote: Inspection may be part of an audit (e.g. product audit), but may also be conducted \noutside of the normal audit plan; for example, to verify closure of a particular finding. \nJust culture Ref. Regulation (EU) No 376/2014, Article 2. \nLine maintenance Ref. AMC1 145.A.10 \nNear miss is an event in which an occurrence to be mandatorily reported according to Regulation \n(EU) No 376/2014 was narrowly averted or avoided. \nExample: A mechanic on rechecking his or her work at the end of a task realises that one \nwork card step was not properly carried out. \nOrganisational \nfactor \nis a condition that affects the effectiveness of safety risk controls, related to the culture, \npolicies, processes, resources, and workplace of an organisation. \nOversight \nplanning cycle \nrefers to the time frame within which all areas of the approval and all processes should \nbe reviewed by the competent authority by means of audits and inspections. \nOversight \nprogramme \nrefers to the detailed oversight schedule that defines the number of audits and \ninspections, the scope and duration of each audit and inspection, including details of \nproduct audits and locations, as appropriate, to be performed by the competent \nauthority, and the tentative time frame for performing each audit and inspection. \nPreventive action is the action to eliminate the cause of a potential non-compliance or other undesirable \npotential situations. \nRisk assessment is an evaluation based on engineering and operational judgement and/or analysis \nmethods in order to establish whether the achieved or perceived risk is acceptable or \ntolerable. \nSafety culture is an enduring set of values, norms, attitudes, and practices within an organisation \nconcerned with minimising the exposure of the workforce and the general public to ",

No other person may issue a certificate of release to service and therefore if that \nperson is absent, no maintenance may be released during such absence. \n(1) The independent audit element of the compliance monitoring function of point \n145.A.200(a)(6) may be subcontracted to an appropriate organisation approved under \nPart-145 or contracted to a person with appropriate technical knowledge and extensive \nexperience of audits, working under the management system of the organisation, with \nthe agreement of the competent authority. \nNote: ‘Full-time’ for the purpose of Part-145 means not less than 35 hrs per week except \nduring vacation periods. \n(2) 145.A.35. In the case of an approval based on one person using an independent audit \nmonitoring arrangement as referred to in point (1), the requirement for a record of \ncertifying staff is satisfied by the submission to and acceptance by the competent \nauthority of the MOE. With only one person, the requirement for a separate record of \nauthorisation is unnecessary because the EASA Form 3 certificate defines the \nauthorisation. An appropriate statement, to reflect this situation, should be included in \nthe exposition. \n(3) 145.A.200(a)(6). It is the responsibility of the organisation or person referred to in point \n(1) to make a minimum of two on-site audits every year, and it is the responsibility of this \norganisation or person to carry out these activities on the basis of one pre-announced \nvisit and one unannounced visit to the maintenance organisation. \nIt is the responsibility of the Part-145 organisation to ensure that effective \nimplementation of all corrective actions takes place.

Where compliance monitoring staff also perform other functions, the time \nallocated to those functions needs to be taken into account in determining the number of \ncompliance monitoring staff. \n7. The maintenance man-hour plan should be reviewed at least every 3 months and updated when \nnecessary. \n8. Significant deviation from the maintenance man-hour plan should be reported through the \ndepartmental manager to the compliance monitoring manager and the accountable manager \nfor review. It may also be reported through the internal safety reporting scheme. A significant \ndeviation means that there is more than a 25% shortfall in available man-hours during a \ncalendar month for any one of the functions specified in point 145.A.30(d). \n9. In addition, as part of its management system in accordance with point 145.A.200, the \norganisation should have a procedure to assess and mitigate the risks: \n(1) if the actual number of staff available is less than the planned staffing level for any \nparticular work shift or period; ",

For that purpose, experience/training may be recorded in a document such as a log \nbook, or based on the suggested template in GM3 145.A.30(e). \nAs a result of this assessment, an individual’s qualifications should determine: \n− the scope of tasks this individual is authorised to perform and/or supervise and/or sign off (as \napplicable) or which level of ongoing supervision would be required; \n− whether there is a need for additional training. \nA record should be kept of each individual’s qualifications and competency assessment (refer also to \npoint 145.A.55(d)). This should include copies of all documents that attest to their qualifications, such \nas a licence and/or any authorisation held, as applicable. \nFor a proper competency assessment of its personnel, the organisation should consider that: \n1. In accordance with the job function, adequate initial and recurrent training has been received \nby the staff and recorded to ensure continued competency so that it is maintained throughout \nthe duration of the employment/contract. \n2. All staff should be able to demonstrate knowledge of, and compliance with, the maintenance \norganisation’s procedures, as applicable to their duties. \n3. All staff should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the safety management principles, \nincluding human factors related to their job function, and be trained as per AMC4 145.A.30(e). \n4. To assist in the assessment of competency and to establish the training needs analysis, job \ndescriptions are recommended for each job function in the organisation. Job descriptions \nshould contain sufficient criteria to enable the required competency assessment. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 361 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n5. Criteria should allow the assessment to establish that, among other aspects (titles might be \ndifferent in each organisation): \n− Managers are able to properly manage the work output, processes, resources and \npriorities described in their assigned duties, accountabilities and responsibilities in \naccordance with the safety policy and objectives and in compliance with the applicable \nrequirements. \n− Planners are able to interpret maintenance requirements into maintenance tasks, and \nhave an understanding that they have no authority to deviate from the maintenance \ndata. They are able to organise maintenance activities in an effective manner and in \nconsideration of human performance limitations. \n− Supervisors are able to ensure that all the required maintenance tasks are carried out \nand, if they are not completed or it is evident that a particular maintenance task cannot \nbe carried out according to the maintenance data, that these problems will be adequately \naddressed to eliminate the non-compliance, and reported through the internal safety \nreporting scheme to prevent their reoccurrence. In addition, for those supervisors, who \nalso carry out maintenance tasks, the assessment should ensure that they understand \nthat such tasks should not be undertaken if they are incompatible with their management \nresponsibilities. \n− Mechanics are able to carry out maintenance tasks to any standard specified in the \nmaintenance data, and will notify their supervisors of any defects or mistakes requiring \nrectification to re-establish the required maintenance standards. \n− Specialised services staff are able to carry out specialised maintenance tasks to the \nstandard specified in the maintenance data. They should be able to communicate with \ntheir supervisors and report accurately when necessary. \n− Support staff are able to determine that the relevant tasks or inspections have been \ncarried out to the required standard. \n− Certifying staff are able to determine when the aircraft or aircraft component \nmaintenance is ready to be released to service and when it should not be released to \nservice. \n− Compliance monitoring staff are able to monitor compliance with this Regulation and to \nidentify non-compliances in an effective and timely manner so that the organisation may \nremain in compliance with this Regulation. \n− Staff who have safety management responsibilities are familiar with the relevant \nprocesses in terms of hazard identification, risk management, and the monitoring of \nsafety performance. \n− All staff are familiar with the safety policy and the procedures and tools that can be used \nfor internal safety reporting. \nThe competency assessment should be based upon the procedure specified in GM2 145.A.30(e).

Sufficient time could range from \nseveral days to several weeks depending on the complexity of the task(s) and the work \nexposure. The person need not be assessed against the complete spectrum of their intended \nduties. If the person has been recruited from another approved maintenance organisation, a \nwritten confirmation from the previous organisation could be taken into consideration to \nreduce the duration of the assessment. \n(c) All prospective maintenance staff should be assessed for their competency related to their \nintended duties. \nAMC3 145.A.30(e) Personnel requirements \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nINITIAL AND RECURRENT TRAINING \n(a) Adequate initial and recurrent training should be provided in relation to the job function to \nensure that staff remain competent. Completion of such training should be recorded. \n(b) Recurrent training should take into account the information reported through the internal \nsafety reporting scheme (see point (c)(3) of AMC1 145.A.202). \n(c) Those responsible for managing the compliance monitoring function should receive training on \nthis task. Such training should cover the requirements of compliance monitoring, manuals and \nprocedures related to the task, audit techniques, reporting, and recording. ",

This \nshould include at least the following staff members: \n− Nominated persons, line managers, supervisors; \n− Certifying staff, support staff and mechanics; \n− Technical support personnel such as planners, engineers, technical record staff; \n− Persons involved in compliance monitoring and/or safety management-related processes \nand tasks, including the application of human factors principles, internal investigations \nand safety training; \n− Specialised services staff; \n− Stores department staff, purchasing department staff; \n− Ground equipment operators. \nThe generic term ‘line managers’ refers to departmental heads or persons responsible for \noperational departments or functional units that are directly involved in the delivery of the basic \nmaintenance services of the organisation. \n(b) Initial safety training should cover all the topics of the training syllabus specified in \nGM1 145.A.30(e) either as a dedicated course or else integrated within other training. The \nsyllabus may be adjusted to reflect the particular nature of the organisation. The syllabus may \nalso be adjusted to suit the particular nature of work for each function within the organisation. \nFor example: \n− small organisations not working in shifts may cover in less depth subjects related to \nteamwork and communication; \n− planners may cover in more depth the scheduling and planning objectives of the syllabus, \nand in less depth the objective of developing skills for shift working. \nAll personnel identified in accordance with point (a) of this AMC, including personnel being \nrecruited from any other organisation should receive initial safety training compliant with the \norganisation’s training standards prior to commencing the actual job function, unless their \ncompetency assessment justifies that there is no need for such training. New, directly employed \npersonnel working under direct supervision may receive training within 6 months after joining \nthe maintenance organisation. \n(c) The purpose of recurrent safety training is primarily to ensure that staff remain current in terms \nof SMS principles and human factors and also to collect feedback on safety and human factors \nissues. Consideration should be given to involving compliance monitoring staff and the key \nsafety management personnel in this training to provide a consistent presence and facilitate \nfeedback.

Notwithstanding the fact that Level 3 personnel may be qualified via EN 4179 to establish and \nauthorise methods, techniques, etc., this does not permit such personnel to deviate from \nmethods and techniques published in the maintenance data, unless the maintenance data the \nexpressly permits such deviation. \n4. Notwithstanding the general references in EN 4179 to a national aerospace non-destructive \ntesting (NDT) board, all examinations should be conducted by personnel or organisations under \nthe general control of such a board. In the absence of a national aerospace NDT board, the \naerospace NDT board of another Member State should be used, as defined by the competent \nauthority. ",

Particular non-destructive test means any one or more of the following; Dye penetrant, \nmagnetic particle, eddy current, ultrasonic and radiographic methods including X ray and \ngamma ray. \n6. It should be noted that new methods are and will be developed, such as, but not limited to \nthermography and shearography, which are not specifically addressed by EN 4179. Until the \ntime this agreed standard is established, such methods should be carried out in accordance with \nthe particular equipment manufacturer’s recommendations including any training and \nexamination process to ensure competence of the personnel in the process. \n7. Any maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 that carries out NDT should establish \nNDT specialist qualification procedures detailed in the exposition and accepted by the \ncompetent authority. \n8. Boroscoping and other techniques such as delamination coin tapping are non-destructive \ninspections rather than non-destructive testing. Notwithstanding such differentiation, the \nmaintenance organisation should establish an exposition procedure accepted by the competent \nauthority to ensure that personnel who carry out and interpret such inspections are properly \ntrained and assessed for their competence in the process. Non-destructive inspections, not \nbeing considered as NDT by Part-145 are not listed in Appendix II under class rating D1. \n9. The referenced standards, methods, training and procedures should be specified in the \nmaintenance organisation exposition. \n10.

The competent authority may accept that in the case of aircraft line maintenance an \norganisation has only B1, B2, B2L, B3 or L certifying staff, as appropriate, provided that the \ncompetent authority is satisfied that the scope of work, as defined in the MOE, does not need \nthe availability of all those categories of certifying staff. Special attention should be taken to \nclearly limit the scope of scheduled and non-scheduled line maintenance (defect rectification) \nto only those tasks that can be certified by the available category of certifying staff. \nAMC1 145.A.30(h) Personnel requirements \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nIn accordance with points 145.A.30(h) and 145.A.35, the qualification requirements (basic licence, \naircraft ratings, recent experience and recurrent training) are identical for certifying staff and for \nsupport staff. The only difference is that support staff cannot hold certification privileges when \nperforming this role since during base maintenance, the release to service will be issued by category \nC certifying staff. \nNevertheless, the organisation may use as support staff (for base maintenance) persons who already \nhold certification privileges for line maintenance. \nAMC1 145.A.30(j)(4) Personnel requirements \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n1. For the issue of a limited certification authorisation, the pilot should hold either an airline \ntransport pilots licence (ATPL) or a commercial pilot licence (CPL) in accordance with Regulation \n(EU) No 1178/2011 and, as applicable, Regulation (EU) 2020/723. \n2. In addition, the limited certification authorisation is subject to the MOE containing procedures \nto address the personnel requirements of point 145.A.30(e). The procedures should be \naccepted by the competent authority and should include as a minimum: \n(a) completion of adequate continuing airworthiness regulation training as related to \nmaintenance; \n(b) completion of adequate task training for the specific task(s) on the aircraft. The task \ntraining should be of sufficient duration to ensure that the individual has a thorough \nunderstanding of the task(s) to be completed, and that it will involve training in the use \nof the associated maintenance data; \n(c) completion of the procedural training as specified in Part-145. \n2.(i) Typical tasks that may be certified and/or carried out by a pilot who holds an ATPL or a CPL are \nthe minor maintenance or simple checks included in the following list: \n(a) Replacement of internal lights, filaments and flash tubes;. \n(b) Closing of cowlings and refitment of quick-access inspection panels;. \n(c) Role changes, e.g. stretcher installation, dual controls, FLIR, doors, photographic \nequipment, etc. \n(d) Inspection for, and removal of, de-icing/anti-icing fluid residues, including the \nremoval/closure of panels, cowls or covers that are easily accessible, but that do not \nrequire the use of special tools;. \n(e) Any check/replacement that involves simple techniques that are consistent with this AMC \nand that have been agreed by the competent authority.

For the purposes of point 145.A.30(j)(5), ‘unforeseen’ means that the grounding of the aircraft \ncould not reasonably have been predicted by the operator because the defect was unexpected, \ndue to it being part of a hitherto reliable system. \n2. Issuing a one-off authorisation should only be considered under the responsibility of the \ncompliance monitoring manager of the contracted organisation after a reasoned judgement has \nbeen made that such an authorisation is appropriate under the circumstances, while at the \nsame time it maintains the required airworthiness standards. The organisation’s compliance \nmonitoring personnel should assess each situation individually prior to issuing a one-off \nauthorisation, and may request contribution from technical and safety management personnel. \n3. A one-off authorisation should not be issued if the level of certification required could exceed \nthe knowledge and experience level of the person it is issued to. In all cases, due consideration \nshould be given to the complexity of the work involved and the availability of the required \ntooling and/or test equipment needed to complete the work. \nAMC 145.A.30(j)(5)(i) Personnel requirements \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nIn case it is necessary to issue a one-off certification authorisation to a certifying staff on an aircraft \ntype for which he or she does not hold a type-rated authorisation, the following procedure is \nrecommended: \n1. The flight crew should communicate full details of the defect to the maintenance organisation. \nIf necessary, the maintenance organisation will then request the use of a one-off authorisation \nfrom the compliance monitoring personnel. \n2. When issuing a one-off authorisation, the compliance monitoring personnel should verify that: \n(a) full technical details relating to the work required to be carried out have been established \nand passed on to the certifying staff;. \n(b) the organisation has an approved procedure in place for coordinating and controlling the \ntotal maintenance activity undertaken at the location under the authority of the one-off \nauthorisation;. \n(c) the person to whom a one-off authorisation is issued has been provided with all the \nnecessary information and guidance relating to maintenance data, and any special \ntechnical instructions associated with the specific task undertaken.

In granting the certification \nauthorisation the maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 needs to be satisfied that the \nperson holds a valid Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence and may need to confirm such fact with the \ncompetent authority of the Member State that issued the licence. \nAMC 145.A.35(c) Certifying staff and support staff \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nFor the interpretation of ‘6 months of actual relevant aircraft maintenance experience in any \nconsecutive 2-year period’, the provisions of AMC 66.A.20(b)2 are applicable. \nAMC1 145.A.35(d) Certifying staff and support staff \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n1. Recurrent training is a two-way process to ensure that certifying staff and support staff remain \ncurrent in terms of the necessary technical knowledge, procedures, and safety management \n(including human factors), and that the organisation receives feedback on the adequacy of its \nprocedures and maintenance instructions. Due to the interactive nature of this training, \nconsideration should be given to involving the compliance monitoring staff and the key safety \nmanagement personnel in this training to provide a consistent presence and facilitate feedback. \nThere should be a procedure to ensure that feedback is formally reported by the trainers \nthrough the internal safety reporting scheme to initiate action where necessary. \n2. Recurrent training should cover changes made to the modification standard of the products \nbeing maintained, to the relevant requirements such as Part-145, to the organisation’s \nprocedures, safety policy and objectives, as well as human factors and safety issues identified \nfrom internal or external analysis of incidents and compliance monitoring results. It should also \naddress instances in which staff failed to follow the procedures, and the reasons why particular ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 381 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nprocedures were not always followed. In many cases, the recurrent training will reinforce the \nneed to follow the procedures and will ensure that incomplete or incorrect procedures are \nidentified to the company so that they can be corrected. It may be necessary to carry out an \naudit of these procedures. \n3. Recurrent training should be of sufficient duration in each 2-year period to meet the intent of \npoint 145.A.35(d) and may be split into a number of separate elements. Point 145.A.35(d) \nrequires such a training to keep certifying staff and support staff updated in terms of relevant \ntechnology, procedures, safety management and human factors issues which means it is one \npart of ensuring compliance. Therefore, sufficient duration should be related to relevant audit \nfindings and other internal / external sources of information available to the organisation on \nhuman errors and safety issues in maintenance. This means that in the case of an organisation \nthat maintains aircraft with limited relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks \nidentified, recurrent training could be limited to days rather than weeks, whereas in the case of \na similar organisation with a number of relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks \nidentified, such a training may take several weeks. For an organisation that maintains aircraft \ncomponents, the duration of recurrent training would follow the same philosophy but should \nbe scaled down to reflect the more limited nature of the activity. For example, certifying staff \nwho release hydraulic pumps may only require a few hours of recurrent training, whereas those \nwho release turbine engines may only require a few days of such a training. The content of \nrecurrent training should be related to relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks \nidentified. It is recommended that such training is reviewed at least once in every 24-month \nperiod. \n4. The method of training is intended to be a flexible process, and this training could, for example, \nbe provided by a Part-147 organisation, an aeronautical college, the Part-145 organisation, or \nanother training or maintenance organisation. The elements, general content and length of \nsuch training should be specified in the MOE. \nAMC1 145.A.35(e) Certifying staff and support staff \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nThe programme for recurrent training should list all certifying staff and support staff and when the \ntraining will take place, the elements of such a training, and an indication that it was carried out on \ntime as planned. Such information should subsequently be transferred to the certifying staff and to \nthe support staff records as required by point 145.A.55(d)(3). \nAMC1 145.A.35(f) Certifying staff and support staff \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nAs stated in point 145.A.35(f), except where any of the unforeseen cases of point 145.A.30(j)(5) \napplies, all prospective certifying staff and support staff should be assessed for their competency \nrelated to their intended duties. Said assessment should be conducted in accordance with AMC 1, 2, \n3, 4 and 5 to point 145.A.30(e), as applicable. \nAMC1 145.A.35(m) Certifying staff and support staff \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n1. It is the responsibility of the Part-145 organisation issuing the category A certifying staff \nauthorisation to ensure that the task training received by this person covers all the tasks to be \nauthorised. This is particularly important in those cases where the task training has been ",

The privilege for a B2 licence holder to release minor scheduled line maintenance and simple \ndefect rectification in accordance with 66.A.20(a)(3)(ii) can only be granted by the Part-145 \napproved organisation where the licence holder is employed/contracted after meeting all the \nrequirements specified in 145.A.35(o). This privilege cannot be transferred to another Part-145 \napproved organisation. \n2. When a B2 licence holder already holds a certifying staff authorisation containing minor \nscheduled line maintenance and simple defect rectification for a particular aircraft type, new \ntasks relevant to category A can be added to that type without requiring another 6 months of \nexperience. However, task training (theoretical plus practical hands-on) and \nexamination/assessment for these additional tasks is still required. \n3. When the certifying staff authorisation intends to cover several aircraft types, the experience \nmay be combined within a single 6-month period. \n4. For the addition of new types to the certifying staff authorisation, another 6 months should be \nrequired unless the aircraft is considered similar per AMC 66.A.20(b)2 to the one already held. \n5. The term ‘6 months of experience’ may include full-time employment or part-time employment. \nThe important aspect is that the person has been involved during a period of 6 months (not \nnecessarily every day) in those tasks which are going to be part of the authorisation. \n145.A.37 Airworthiness review staff \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1963 \n(a) In order to be approved to carry out airworthiness reviews and to issue the corresponding \nairworthiness review certificates (ARC) for aircraft covered by Annex Vb (Part-ML), the \norganisation shall have airworthiness review staff that comply with all of the following \nrequirements: \n(1) they have acquired experience in continuing airworthiness of at least 1 year for sailplanes \nand balloons and of at least 3 years for all other aircraft; \n(2) they hold a certifying staff authorisation for the corresponding aircraft; \n(3) they have acquired knowledge of Annex I (Part-M), Subpart C, or of Annex Vb (Part-ML), \nSubpart C; \n(4) they have acquired knowledge of the procedures of the maintenance organisation \nrelevant to the airworthiness review and issue of the airworthiness review certificate. \n(b) Before the organisation issues an airworthiness review authorisation to a candidate, that \nperson shall perform an airworthiness review under the supervision of the competent authority \nor under the supervision of a person that is already authorised as airworthiness review staff by ",

All such tools and equipment that require to \nbe controlled in terms of servicing or calibration by virtue of being necessary to measure specified \ndimensions and torque figures, etc., should be clearly identified and listed in a control register \nincluding any personal tools and equipment that the organisation agrees can be used. \nAMC 145.A.40(b) Equipment and tools \nED Decision 2019/009/R \n1. The control of these tools and equipment requires that the organisation has a procedure to \ninspect/service and, where appropriate, calibrate such items on a regular basis and indicate to \nusers that the item is within any inspection or service or calibration time-limit. A clear system \nof labelling all tooling, equipment and test equipment is therefore necessary giving information \non when the next inspection or service or calibration is due and if the item is unserviceable for \nany other reason where it may not be obvious. A register should be maintained for all precision \ntooling and equipment together with a record of calibrations and standards used. \n2. Inspection, service or calibration on a regular basis should be in accordance with the equipment \nmanufacturers' instructions except where the organisation can show by results that a different \ntime period is appropriate in a particular case. \n3. In this context officially recognised standard means those standards established or published \nby an official body whether having legal personality or not, which are widely recognised by the \nair transport sector as constituting good practice.

This evaluation may be limited to a questionnaire from the Part-145 \norganisation to its suppliers, a desktop evaluation of the supplier’s procedures or an on-site \naudit, if deemed necessary. \nGM1 145.A.42(b)(ii) Components \nED Decision 2021/009/R \nINSTALLATION OF COMPONENTS \nComponents, standard parts and materials should only be installed when they are specified in the \napplicable maintenance data as specified in 145.A.45(b). So, the installation of a component, standard \npart or material can only be done after checking the applicable maintenance data. \nThis check should ensure that the part number, modification status, limitations, etc., of the \ncomponent, standard part or material are the ones specified in the applicable maintenance data of \nthe particular aircraft or component where the component, standard part or material is going to be \ninstalled. The organisation should establish procedures to ensure that this check is performed before \ninstallation. \nAMC1 145.A.42(b)(iii) Components \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nFABRICATION OF PARTS FOR INSTALLATION \n(a) The agreement of the competent authority on the fabrication of parts by the approved \nmaintenance organisation should be formalised through the approval of a detailed procedure \nin the Maintenance Organisation Exposition (MOE). This AMC contains principles and conditions \nto be taken into account for the preparation of an acceptable procedure. \n(b) Fabrication, inspection, assembly and test should be clearly within the technical and procedural \ncapability of the organisation. \n(c) All necessary data to fabricate the part should be approved either by the Agency or the type \ncertificate (TC) holder, or Part 21 design organisation approval holder, or supplemental type \ncertificate (STC) holder, or should be declared by the declarant of a declaration of design \ncompliance or, if applicable for a minor change, by a Part 21 design organisation approval \nholder.

The permission to fabricate does not \nconstitute approval for manufacture, or to supply externally, and the parts do not qualify for \nEASA Form 1 certification. This prohibition also applies to the bulk transfer of surplus inventory, \nin that locally fabricated parts are physically segregated and excluded from any delivery \ncertification. \n(e) Fabrication of parts, modification kits, etc., for onward supply and/or sale may not be conducted \nby an organisation that is approved under Part-145. \n(f) The data specified in (c) may include repair procedures that involve the fabrication of parts. \nWhere the data on such parts is sufficient to facilitate fabrication, the parts may be fabricated \nby an organisation that is approved under Part-145. Care should be taken to ensure that the \ndata include details of part numbering, dimensions, materials, processes, and any special \nmanufacturing techniques, special raw material specification and/or incoming inspection \nrequirement, and that the approved organisation has the necessary capability to fabricate those \nparts. That capability should be defined by way of exposition content. Where special processes \nor inspection procedures are defined in the approved or declared (in accordance with Part 21 \nLight Subpart C) data, which are not available at the organisation, the organisation cannot \nfabricate the part unless the TC/STC holder or the declarant of a declaration of design \ncompliance gives an approved alternative. \n(g) Examples of fabrication within the scope of a Part-145 approval may include but are not limited \nto the following: \n(1) fabrication of bushes, sleeves and shims; \n(2) fabrication of secondary structural elements and skin panels; \n(3) fabrication of control cables; \n(4) fabrication of flexible and rigid pipes; \n(5) fabrication of electrical cable looms and assemblies; \n(6) formed or machined sheet metal panels for repairs. \nAll the above-mentioned fabricated parts should be in accordance with the data provided in the \noverhaul or repair manuals, modification schemes and service bulletins, drawings, or should be \notherwise approved by the competent authority. \nNote: It is not acceptable to fabricate any item to pattern unless an engineering drawing of the \nitem is produced which includes any necessary fabrication process and which is acceptable to \nthe competent authority. \n(h) Where a TC holder or declarant of a declaration of design compliance, or an approved or \ndeclared (in accordance with Part 21 Light Subpart G) production organisation, or a production \norganisation using Part 21 Light Subpart R is prepared to make available complete data which \nis not referred to in the aircraft manuals or service bulletins but provides manufacturing \ndrawings for items specified in parts lists, the fabrication of these items is not considered to be \nwithin the scope of an approval unless agreed otherwise by the competent authority in \naccordance with a procedure specified in the exposition. \n(i) Inspection and identification \nAny locally fabricated part should be subject to inspection before, separately, and preferably \nindependently from any inspection of its installation.

Adequate records should be maintained of all such fabrication \nprocesses including heat treatment and final inspections. All parts, except those that do not \nhave enough space, should carry a part number which clearly relates it to the \nmanufacturing/inspection data. In addition to the part’s number, the organisation’s identity \nshould be marked on the part for traceability purposes. \nAMC1 145.A.42(c) Components \nED Decision 2019/009/R \nSEGREGATION OF COMPONENTS \n(a) Unserviceable components should be identified and stored in a secure location that is under \nthe control of the maintenance organisation until a decision is made on the future status of such \ncomponents. The organisation that declared the component to be unserviceable may transfer \nits custody after identifying it as unserviceable to the aircraft owner provided that such transfer \nis reflected in the aircraft logbook, or engine logbook, or component logbook. \n(b) ‘Secure location under the control of an approved maintenance organisation’ refers to a secure \nlocation whose security is the responsibility of the approved maintenance organisation. This \nmay include facilities that are established by the organisation at locations different from the \nmain maintenance facilities. These locations should be identified in the relevant procedures of \nthe organisation. \n(c) In the case of unsalvageable components, the organisation should: \n(1) retain such component in the secure location referred to in paragraph (b); \n(2) arrange for the component to be mutilated in a manner that ensures that they are \nbeyond economic salvage or repair before disposing it; or \n(3) mark the component indicating that it is unsalvageable, when in agreement with the \ncomponent owner, the component is disposed of for legitimate non-flight uses (such as \ntraining and education aids, research and development), or for non-aviation applications, \nmutilation is often not appropriate. Alternatively to marking, the original part number or \ndata plate information can be removed or a record kept of the disposal of the \ncomponents. \nGM1 145.A.42(c)(i) Components \nED Decision 2019/009/R \nMUTILATION OF COMPONENTS \n(a) Mutilation should be accomplished in such a manner that the components become \npermanently unusable for their originally intended use. Mutilated components should not be \nable to be reworked or camouflaged to provide the appearance of being serviceable, such as by \nreplating, shortening and rethreading long bolts, welding, straightening, machining, cleaning, \npolishing, or repainting. \n(b) Mutilation may be accomplished by one or a combination of the following procedures: \n(1) grinding; \n(2) burning; ",

With respect to changes to maintenance instructions, the \norganisation shall demonstrate that they result in equivalent or improved maintenance \nstandards, and shall inform the author of the maintenance instructions of such changes. For the \npurposes of this point, “maintenance instructions” mean instructions on how to carry out a \nparticular maintenance task; they exclude the engineering design of repairs and modifications. \n(e) The organisation shall provide a common work card or worksheet system to be used throughout \nthe relevant parts of the organisation. In addition, the organisation shall either accurately \ntranscribe the maintenance data referred to in points (b) and (d) onto such work cards or \nworksheets, or make precise reference to the particular maintenance task or tasks contained in ",

Modified maintenance instructions should only be used in the \nfollowing circumstances: \n(a) Where the original intent of the maintenance instruction can be carried out in a more practical \nor more efficient manner. \n(b) Where the original intent of the maintenance instruction cannot be achieved when following \nthe maintenance instructions. For example, where a component cannot be replaced following \nthe original maintenance instructions. \n(c) For the use of alternative tools / equipment. \nImportant Note: Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) are airworthiness \nlimitations. Any modification of the maintenance instructions linked to CDCCL constitutes a change to \na (restricted) type certificate that should be approved in accordance with Part 21 or Part 21 Light. \nAMC1 145.A.45(e) Maintenance data \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n1. ‘The relevant parts of the organisation’ means, as appropriate, aircraft base maintenance, \naircraft line maintenance, specialised services, component workshops such as engine \nworkshops, mechanical workshops or avionics workshops. Therefore, a common system should \nbe used, for example, throughout the engine workshops, which may be different from that in \nthe aircraft base maintenance. \n2. The work cards should differentiate and specify, when relevant, disassembly, accomplishment \nof tasks, reassembly and testing as well as the error-capturing method (e.g. independent \ninspection). In the case of a lengthy maintenance task involving a succession of personnel to \ncomplete such a task, it may be necessary to use supplementary work cards or worksheets to \nindicate what was actually accomplished by each individual person. \n3. With reference to point 145.A.65(a), human factors should be taken into account during the \ndevelopment of work cards and worksheets. \n4. ‘Complex or long maintenance tasks’ refers to tasks involving multiple disciplines or multiple \nshifts, or multiple zones/access opening, special tools, etc., or a combination of these. \nThe stages into which the work cards are to be subdivided should refer to where work can be \ninterrupted. Subdivision should also indicate when a different discipline continues to work if no \nseparate work cards are provided. \n5. Where required by the operator/CAMO/CAO to use their work card or worksheet system, the \nmaintenance organisation should assess the system for compliance with the maintenance \norganisation procedures, for example, the subdivision of complex or long maintenance tasks. \nAMC 145.A.45(f) Maintenance data \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1.

Depending on the amount and complexity of work generally performed by the maintenance \norganisation, the planning system may range from a very simple procedure to a complex \norganisational set-up including a dedicated planning function in support of the production \nfunction. \n2. For the purpose of Part-145, the production planning function includes two complementary \nelements: \n− scheduling the maintenance work ahead, to ensure that it will not adversely interfere \nwith other work as regards the availability of all necessary personnel, tools, equipment, \nmaterial, maintenance data and facilities. \n− during maintenance work, organising maintenance teams and shifts and provide all \nnecessary support to ensure the completion of maintenance without undue time \npressure. \n3.

In this respect, where the \norganisation activity is prone to fatigue issues, the organisation should: \n(1) ensure that the safety policy required by point 145.A.200(a) gives due consideration to \nthe aspects of fatigue; \n(2) ensure that the internal safety reporting scheme required by point 145.A.202 enables the \ncollection of fatigue issues; \n(3) ensure that the threat of fatigue is adequately taken into account by the management \nsystem key processes (e.g. assessment, management, monitoring); \n(4) provide safety promotion material and adapt safety training accordingly. \n(c) The organising of shifts should consider good practices in the maintenance domain and \napplicable rules. The resulting shift schedule should be shared with the maintenance staff \nsufficiently in advance so they can plan adequate rest. \nThe established shift durations should not be exceeded merely for management convenience \neven when staff is willing to work extended hours. \n(d) The organisation should have a procedure (including mitigations) to address cases where the \nworking hours are to be significantly increased, or when the shift pattern is to be significantly \nmodified, such as for urgent operational reasons. In cases not covered by that procedure, the \norganisation should perform a specific risk assessment and define additional mitigation actions, \nas applicable. Basic mitigations may include: \n(1) additional supervision and independent inspection; \n(2) limitation of maintenance tasks to non-critical tasks; \n(3) use of additional rest breaks. ",

An ‘authorised person’ is not necessarily ‘certifying staff’. \nSIGN-OFF \nA ‘sign-off’ is a statement issued by the ‘authorised person’ which indicates that the task or group of \ntasks has been correctly performed. A ‘sign-off’ relates to one step in the maintenance process and is, \ntherefore, different to a certificate of release to service. ",

This point means that the \ncompetent authority need not amend the approval to delete the aircraft type or variants, or \ncomponent on the basis that it is a temporary situation and there is a commitment from the \norganisation to re-acquire tools, equipment etc. before maintenance on the related aircraft or \ncomponent may recommence. \nGM1 145.A.48(c) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCRITICAL DESIGN CONFIGURATION CONTROL LIMITATIONS (CDCCL) \nThe organisation should ensure that when performing maintenance the CDCCL are not compromised. \nThe organisation should pay particular attention to possible adverse effects of any change to the \nwiring of the aircraft, even of a change not specifically associated with the fuel tank system. For \nexample, it should be common practice to identify the segregation of fuel gauging system wiring as a \nCDCCL. The organisation can prevent adverse effects associated with changes to the wiring by \nstandardising maintenance practices through training, and not through periodic inspections. Training \nshould be provided to avoid indiscriminate routing and splicing of wires and to provide comprehensive \nknowledge of critical design features of fuel tank systems that would be controlled by a CDCCL. \nGuidance on the training of maintenance organisation personnel is provided in Appendix IV to AMC5 \n145.A.30(e) and AMC2 145.B.200(a)(3)_DxCrossRefBm1385130162. \nAMC1 145.A.48(c)(2) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nThe organisation should have a procedure to identify the error-capturing methods, the critical \nmaintenance tasks, the training and the qualifications of staff applying error-capturing methods, and \nhow the organisation ensures that its staff is familiar with critical maintenance tasks and error- \ncapturing methods. \nAMC2 145.A.48(c)(2) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nCRITICAL MAINTENANCE TASKS \n(a) The procedure should ensure that the following maintenance tasks are reviewed to assess their \nimpact on flight safety: \n(1) tasks that may affect the control of the aircraft flight path and attitude, such as \ninstallation, rigging and adjustments of flight controls; \n(2) aircraft stability control systems (autopilot, fuel transfer); \n(3) tasks that may affect the propulsive force of the aircraft, including installation of aircraft \nengines, propellers and rotors; and \n(4) overhaul, calibration or rigging of engines, propellers, transmissions and gearboxes. \n(b) The procedure should describe which data sources are used to identify critical maintenance \ntasks. Several data sources may be used, such as: ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 402 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(1) information from the design approval holder or the declarant of a declaration of design \ncompliance; \n(2) accident reports; \n(3) investigation and follow-up of incidents; \n(4) occurrence reporting; \n(5) flight data analysis, where this is available from the person or organisation responsible \nfor the aircraft continuing airworthiness; \n(6) results of audits and independent inspections; \n(7) monitoring schemes for normal operations, where these are available from the person \nor organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness; \n(8) feedback from training. \nAMC3 145.A.48(c)(2) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nERROR-CAPTURING METHODS \n(a) Error-capturing methods are those actions defined by the organisation to detect maintenance \nerrors that are made while performing maintenance. \n(b) The organisation should ensure that the error-capturing methods are adequate for the work \nand the disturbance of the system. A combination of several actions (e.g. visual inspection, \noperational check, functional test, rigging check) may be necessary in some cases. \nAMC4 145.A.48(c)(2) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nINDEPENDENT INSPECTION \nIndependent inspection is one possible error-capturing method. \n(a) What is an independent inspection \nAn independent inspection is an inspection performed by an ‘independent qualified person’ of \na task carried out by an ‘authorised person’, taking into account that: \n(1) the ‘authorised person’ is the person who performs the task or supervises the task and \nthey assume the full responsibility for the completion of the task in accordance with the \napplicable maintenance data; \n(2) the ‘independent qualified person’ is the person who performs the independent \ninspection and attests the satisfactory completion of the task and that no deficiencies \nhave been found. The ‘independent qualified person’ does not issue a certificate of \nrelease to service, therefore they are not required to hold certification privileges; \n(3) the ‘authorised person’ issues the certificate of release to service or signs off the \ncompletion of the task after the independent inspection has been carried out \nsatisfactorily; \n(4) the work card system used by the organisation should record the identification of both \npersons and the details of the independent inspection as necessary before the certificate \nof release to service or sign-off for the completion of the task is issued.

    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 403 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(b) Qualifications of persons performing independent inspections \nThe organisation should have procedures to demonstrate that the ‘independent qualified \nperson’ has been trained and has gained experience in the specific inspection to be performed. \nThe organisation could consider making use of, for example: \n(1) staff holding a certifying staff or support staff or sign-off authorisation or equivalent \nnecessary to release or sign off the critical maintenance task; \n(2) staff holding a certifying staff or support staff or sign-off authorisation or equivalent \nnecessary to release or sign off similar task in a product of similar category and having \nreceived specific practical training in the task to be inspected; or \n(3) a commander holding a limited certification authorisation in accordance with \n145.A.30(j)(4) and having received adequate practical training and having enough \nexperience in the specific task to be inspected and on how to perform independent \ninspection. \n(c) How to perform an independent inspection \nAn independent inspection should ensure correct assembly, locking and sense of operation. \nWhen inspecting control systems that have undergone maintenance, the independent qualified \nperson should consider the following points independently: \n(1) all those parts of the system that have actually been disconnected or disturbed should be \ninspected for correct assembly and locking; \n(2) the system as a whole should be inspected for full and free movement over the complete \nrange; \n(3) cables should be tensioned correctly with adequate clearance at secondary stops; \n(4) the operation of the control system as a whole should be observed to ensure that the \ncontrols are operating in the correct sense; \n(5) if different control systems are interconnected so that they affect each other, all the \ninteractions should be checked through the full range of the applicable controls; and \n(6) software that is part of the critical maintenance task should be checked, for example: \nversion, compatibility with aircraft configuration. \n(d) What to do in unforeseen cases when only one person is available \nREINSPECTION: \n(1) Reinspection is an error-capturing method subject to the same conditions as an \nindependent inspection is, except that the ‘authorised person’ performing the \nmaintenance task is also acting as ‘independent qualified person’ and performs the \ninspection. \n(2) Reinspection, as an error-capturing method, should only be performed in unforeseen \ncircumstances when only one person is available to carry out the task and perform the \nindependent inspection. The circumstances cannot be considered unforeseen if the \nperson or organisation has not assigned a suitable ‘independent qualified person’ to that \nparticular line station or shift. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 404 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(3) The certificate of release to service is issued after the task has been performed by the \n‘authorised person’ and the reinspection has been carried out satisfactorily. The work \ncard system used by the organisation should record the identification and the details of \nthe reinspection before the certificate of release to service for the task is issued. \nAMC1 145.A.48(c)(3) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nThe procedures should be aimed at: \n(a) minimising errors and preventing omissions. Therefore, the procedures should specify: \n(1) that every maintenance task is signed off only after completion; \n(2) how the grouping of tasks for the purpose of sign-off allows critical steps to be clearly \nidentified; and \n(3) that work performed by personnel under supervision (i.e. temporary staff, trainees) is \nchecked and signed off by an authorised person; \n(b) minimising the possibility of an error being repeated in identical tasks and, therefore, \ncompromising more than one system or function. Thus, the procedures should ensure that no \nperson is required to perform a maintenance task involving removal/installation or \nassembly/disassembly of several components of the same type fitted to more than one system, \na failure of which could have an impact on safety, on the same aircraft or component during a \nparticular maintenance check. However, in unforeseen circumstances when only one person is \navailable, the organisation may make use of reinspection as described in point (d) of AMC4 \n145.A.48(c)(2). \nGM1 145.A.48(c)(3) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nTo minimise the risk of errors during maintenance and the risk of errors being repeated in identical \nmaintenance tasks, the organisation may implement: \n− procedures to plan the performance by different persons of the same task in different systems; \n− independent inspection or re-inspection procedures. \n145.A.50 Certification of maintenance \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1963 \n(a) A certificate of release to service shall be issued by appropriately authorised certifying staff on \nbehalf of the organisation when that certifying staff has verified that all the maintenance that \nwas ordered has been properly carried out by the organisation in accordance with the \nprocedures specified in point 145.A.70, taking into account the availability and use of the \nmaintenance data specified in point 145.A.45, and that there are no known non-compliances \nwhich endanger flight safety. \n(b) A certificate of release to service shall be issued before flight at the completion of any \nmaintenance. \n(c) New defects or incomplete maintenance work orders identified during the maintenance shall \nbe brought to the attention of the person or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing \nairworthiness for the specific purpose of obtaining agreement to rectify such defects or ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 405 of 1265| Jul 2024 \ncompleting the missing elements of the maintenance work order. In the case where that person \nor organisation declines to have such maintenance carried out under this point, point (e) is \napplicable. \n(d) A certificate of release to service shall be issued by appropriately authorised certifying staff on \nbehalf of the organisation after the maintenance that was ordered has been carried out on a \ncomponent whilst it was off the aircraft. The authorised release certificate “EASA Form 1” \nreferred to in Appendix II of Annex I (Part-M) constitutes the component certificate of release \nto service except if otherwise specified in point M.A.502 of Annex I (Part-M) or ML.A.502 of \nAnnex Vb (Part-ML), as applicable. When an organisation maintains a component for its own \nuse, the EASA Form 1 may not be necessary if the organisation’s internal release procedures in \nits MOE so provides. \n(e) By derogation to point (a), when the organisation is unable to complete all maintenance \nordered, it may issue a certificate of release to service within the approved aircraft limitations. \nThe organisation shall enter such fact in the aircraft certificate of release to service before the \nissue of such certificate. \n(f) By way of derogation from point 145.A.50(a) and point 145.A.42, when an aircraft is grounded \nat a location other than the main line station or main maintenance base due to the non- \navailability of a component with the appropriate release certificate, the organisation contracted \nfor the maintenance of that aircraft may temporarily fit a component without the appropriate \nrelease certificate for a maximum of 30 flight hours or until the aircraft first returns to the main \nline station or main maintenance base, whichever is the sooner, subject to the agreement of \nthe person or organisation responsible for the aircraft’s continuing airworthiness and subject to \nthat component having a suitable release certificate but otherwise in compliance with all \napplicable maintenance and operational requirements. Such components shall be removed by \nthe time limit provided for in the first sentence of this point unless an appropriate release \ncertificate has been obtained in the meantime under points 145.A.50(a) and 145.A.42. \nAMC 145.A.50 Certification of maintenance after embodiment of a \nStandard Change or Standard Repair (SC/SR) \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nAMC M.A.801 of the AMC to Part-M and AMC1 ML.A.801 of the AMC to Part-ML contain acceptable \nmeans of compliance for the release to service of a SC/SR by an organisation approved in accordance \nwith Part-145. \nGM1 145.A.50(a) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n’Endanger flight safety’ means any instances where safe operation could not be assured, or which \ncould lead to an unsafe condition. These typically include, but are not limited to, significant cracking, \ndeformation, corrosion or failure of primary structure, any evidence of burning, electrical arcing, \nsignificant hydraulic fluid or fuel leakage, and any emergency system or total system failure. An \nairworthiness directive that is overdue for compliance is also considered to be a hazard to flight safety. \nHowever, the intent is not to require the maintenance organisation to find or become responsible for \nhidden non-compliances which are not expected to be discovered during the ordered maintenance. \nA certificate of release to service issued by a maintenance organisation certifies that the performed \nmaintenance work, as agreed in the work order or the contract, has been completed in accordance ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 406 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nwith the applicable requirements and the maintenance organisation’s approved procedures. In the \ncase of aircraft maintenance, it does not necessarily mean that the aircraft is in airworthy condition. \nEnsuring that the aircraft is airworthy before each flight always remains the responsibility of the \nperson or organisation managing the aircraft continuing airworthiness. \nAMC 145.A.50(b) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n1. The certificate of release to service should contain the following statement: \n‘Certifies that the work specified, except as otherwise specified, was carried out in accordance \nwith Part-145 and in respect to that work the aircraft/aircraft component is considered ready \nfor release to service’. \nReference should also be made to the EASA Part-145 approval number and the identity of the \nperson who issued the release. \n2. It is acceptable to use an alternate abbreviated certificate of release to service consisting of the \nfollowing statement ‘Part-145 release to service’ instead of the full certification statement \nspecified in paragraph 1. When the alternate abbreviated certificate of release to service is \nused, the introductory section of the technical log should include an example of the full \ncertification statement from paragraph 1. \n3. The certificate of release to service should relate to the task specified in the instructions issued \nby the (S)TC holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance or operator or in the \naircraft maintenance programme which itself may cross-refer to maintenance data. \n4. The date such maintenance was carried out should include when the maintenance took place \nrelative to any life or overhaul limitation in terms of date/flying hours/cycles/landings etc., as \nappropriate. \n5. When extensive maintenance has been carried out, it is acceptable for the certificate of release \nto service to summarise the maintenance as long as there is a unique cross-reference to the \nwork package containing full details of maintenance carried out. Dimensional information \nshould be retained in the work-pack record. \nAMC1 145.A.50(d) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nThe purpose of the certificate is to certify maintenance work carried out on \nassemblies/items/components/parts (hereafter referred to as ‘item(s)’). It also allows the removal \nfrom aircraft of items in a ‘serviceable’ condition in accordance with AMC2 145.A.50(d) in order to fit \nthem to another aircraft/aircraft component. \nThe certificate is to be used for export/import purposes, as well as for domestic purposes, and serves \nas an official certificate for items from the manufacturer/maintenance organisation to users. \nIt can only be issued by organisations approved by the particular competent authority within the scope \nof the approval. \nThe certificate may be used as a rotable tag by utilising the available space on the reverse side of the \ncertificate for any additional information and dispatching the item with two copies of the certificate \nso that one copy may be eventually returned with the item to the maintenance organisation. The \nalternative solution is to use existing rotable tags and also supply a copy of the certificate. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 407 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nA certificate should not be issued for any item when it is known that the item is unserviceable except \nin the case of an item undergoing a series of maintenance processes at several maintenance \norganisations approved under Part-145 and the item needs a certificate for the previous maintenance \nprocess carried out for the next maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 to accept the \nitem for subsequent maintenance processes. In such a case, a clear statement of limitation should be \nendorsed in Block 12. \nAMC2 145.A.50(d) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n1. A component which has been maintained off the aircraft needs the issuance of a certificate of \nrelease to service for such maintenance and another certificate of release to service in regard \nto being installed properly on the aircraft when such action occurs. \nWhen an organisation maintains a component for use by the same organisation, an EASA Form 1 \nmay not be necessary depending upon the organisation’s internal release procedures defined \nin the maintenance organisation exposition. \n2. In the case of the issue of EASA Form 1 for components in storage before Part-145 and Part-21 \nbecame effective and not released on an EASA Form 1 or equivalent in accordance with \n145.A.42(a) or removed serviceable from a serviceable aircraft or an aircraft which has been \nwithdrawn from service the following applies: \n2.1. An EASA Form 1 may be issued for an aircraft component which has been: \n− Maintained before Part-145 became effective or manufactured before Part-21 \nbecame effective. \n− Used on an aircraft and removed in a serviceable condition. Examples include \nleased and loaned aircraft components. \n− Removed from aircraft which have been withdrawn from service, or from aircraft \nwhich have been involved in abnormal occurrences such as accidents, incidents, \nheavy landings or lightning strikes. \n− Maintained by an unapproved organisation. \n2.2. An appropriately rated maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 may issue an \nEASA Form 1 as detailed in this AMC subparagraph 2.5 to 2.9, as appropriate, in \naccordance with procedures detailed in the exposition as approved by the competent \nauthority. The appropriately rated organisation is responsible for ensuring that all \nreasonable measures have been taken to ensure that only approved and serviceable \naircraft components are issued an EASA Form 1 under this paragraph. \n2.3. For the purposes of this AMC No 2 only, appropriately rated means an organisation with \nan approval class rating for the type of component or for the product in which it may be \ninstalled. \n2.4. An EASA Form 1 issued in accordance with this paragraph 2 should be issued by signing \nin block 14b and stating ‘Inspected/Tested’ in block 11. In addition, block 12 should \nspecify: \n2.4.1.

The EASA \nForm 1 should be issued in accordance with the following subparagraphs which \nshould be included in a procedure within the maintenance organisation manual. \nNote 1: It should be understood that the release of a stored but unused aircraft \ncomponent in accordance with this paragraph represents a maintenance release \nunder Part-145 and not a production release under Part-21. It is not intended to \nbypass the production release procedure agreed by the Member State for parts \nand subassemblies intended for fitment on the manufacturers’ own production \nline. \n(a) An acceptance test report or statement should be available for all used and \nunused aircraft components that are subjected to acceptance testing after \nmanufacturing or maintenance as appropriate. \n(b) The aircraft component should be inspected for compliance with the \nmanufacturer’s instructions and limitations for storage and condition \nincluding any requirement for limited storage life, inhibitors, controlled \nclimate and special storage containers. In addition or in the absence of \nspecific storage instructions the aircraft component should be inspected for \ndamage, corrosion and leakage to ensure good condition. \n(c) The storage life used of any storage life-limited parts should be established. \n2.5.2. If it is not possible to establish satisfactory compliance with all applicable \nconditions specified in subparagraph 2.5.1(a) to (c) inclusive, the aircraft \ncomponent should be disassembled by an appropriately rated organisation and \nsubjected to a check for incorporated airworthiness directives, repairs and \nmodifications and inspected/tested in accordance with the maintenance data to \nestablish satisfactory condition and, if relevant, all seals, lubricants and life-limited \nparts should be replaced.

This should, where known, include the \npossible need for the alignment of scheduled maintenance that may be necessary \nto comply with the maintenance programme applicable to the aircraft on which \nthe component is to be installed. \n(d) Irrespective of whether the aircraft holds a certificate of airworthiness or not, the \norganisation responsible for certifying any removed component should ensure that \nthe manner in which the components were removed and stored are compatible \nwith the standards required by Part-145. \n(e) A structured plan should be formulated to control the aircraft disassembly process. \nThe disassembly is to be carried out by an appropriately rated organisation under \nthe supervision of certifying staff who will ensure that the aircraft components are \nremoved and documented in a structured manner in accordance with the \nappropriate maintenance data and disassembly plan. \n(f) All recorded aircraft defects should be reviewed and the possible effects these may \nhave on both normal and standby functions of removed components are to be \nconsidered. \n(g) Dedicated control documentation is to be used as detailed by the disassembly plan, \nto facilitate the recording of all maintenance actions and component removals \nperformed during the disassembly process. Components found to be unserviceable \nare to be identified as such and quarantined pending a decision on the actions to \nbe taken. Records of the maintenance accomplished to establish serviceability are \nto form part of the component maintenance history. \n(h) Suitable Part-145 facilities for the removal and storage of removed components \nare to be used which include suitable environmental conditions, lighting, access \nequipment, aircraft tooling and storage facilities for the work to be undertaken. \nWhile it may be acceptable for components to be removed, given local \nenvironmental conditions, without the benefit of an enclosed facility, subsequent \ndisassembly (if required) and storage of the components should be in accordance \nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations. \n2.8. Used aircraft components maintained by organisations not approved in accordance with \nPart-145. For used components maintained by a maintenance organisation not approved \nunder Part-145, due care should be taken before acceptance of such components. In such \ncases an appropriately rated maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 should \nestablish satisfactory conditions by: \n(a) dismantling the component for sufficient inspection in accordance with the \nappropriate maintenance data; \n(b) replacing all life-limited parts and time-controlled components when no \nsatisfactory evidence of life used is available and/or the components are in an \nunsatisfactory condition; ",

Used aircraft components removed from an aircraft involved in an accident or incident. \nSuch components should only be issued with an EASA Form 1 when processed in \naccordance with paragraph 2.7 and a specific work order including all additional \nnecessary tests and inspections deemed necessary by the accident or incident. Such a \nwork order may require input from the TC holder or the declarant of a declaration of \ndesign compliance or original manufacturer as appropriate. This work order should be \nreferenced in block 12. \nGM 145.A.50(d) EASA Form 1 Block 12 ‘Remarks’ \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nExamples of data to be entered in this block as appropriate: \n− Maintenance documentation used, including the revision status, for all work performed and not \nlimited to the entry made in block 11. \n− A statement such as ‘in accordance with the CMM’ is not acceptable. \n− NDT methods with appropriate documentation used when relevant. \n− Compliance with airworthiness directives or service bulletins. \n− Repairs carried out. \n− Modifications carried out. \n− Replacement parts installed. \n− Life-limited parts status. \n− Shelf life limitations. \n− Deviations from the customer work order. \n− Release statements to satisfy a foreign Civil Aviation Authority maintenance requirement. \n− Information needed to support shipment with shortages or re-assembly after delivery. \n− References to aid traceability, such as batch numbers. \nAMC1 145.A.50(e) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n1. Being unable to establish full compliance with point 145.A.50(a) means that the maintenance \nrequired by the person or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness \ncould not be completed due to either running out of available aircraft maintenance downtime \nfor the scheduled check, or by virtue of the condition of the aircraft requiring additional \nmaintenance downtime, or because the maintenance data requires a flight to be performed as \npart of the maintenance, as described in paragraph 4. \n2. The person or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness is responsible \nfor ensuring that all required maintenance has been carried out before flight and therefore \n145.A.50(e) requires such person or organisation to be informed in the case where full \ncompliance with 145.A.50(a) cannot be achieved within the relevant limitations. If that person ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 412 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nor organisation agrees to the deferment of full compliance, then the certificate of release to \nservice may be issued subject to details of the deferment, including the competent authority of \nthe State of Registry, being endorsed on the certificate. \nNote: Whether or not the person or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing \nairworthiness does have the authority to defer maintenance is an issue between that person or \norganisation and the competent authority of the State of Registry. In case of doubt concerning \nsuch a decision, the approved maintenance organisation should inform its competent authority \nof such doubt, before issuing the certificate of release to service. This will allow this competent \nauthority to investigate the matter with the competent authority of the State of Registry or the \nState of the operator as appropriate. \n3. The procedure should draw attention to the fact that 145.A.50(a) does not normally permit the \nissue of a certificate of release to service in the case of non-compliance and should state what \naction the mechanic, supervisor and certifying staff should take to bring the matter to the \nattention of the relevant department or person responsible for technical co-ordination with the \nperson or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness so that the issue \nmay be discussed and resolved with that person or organisation. In addition, the appropriate \nperson(s) as specified in point 145.A.30(b) should be kept informed in writing of such possible \nnon-compliance situations and this should be included in the procedure. \n4. Certain maintenance data issued by the design approval holder or the declarant of a declaration \nof design compliance (e.g. aircraft maintenance manual (AMM)) requires that a maintenance \ntask be performed in flight as a necessary condition to complete the maintenance ordered. \nWithin the aircraft limitations, an appropriately authorised certifying staff should release the \nincomplete maintenance before the flight on behalf of the maintenance organisation. GM \nM.A.301(i) or GM1 ML.A.301(f) describe the relations with the aircraft operator, which retains \nthe responsibility for the maintenance check flight (MCF). After performing the flight and any \nadditional maintenance necessary to complete the maintenance ordered, a certificate of \nrelease to service should be issued in accordance with 145.A.50(a). \nAMC1 145.A.50(f) Certification of maintenance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \n1. Suitable release certificate means a certificate which clearly states that the aircraft component \nis serviceable; that clearly specifies the organisation releasing said component together with \ndetails of the authority under whose approval the organisation works including the approval or \nauthorisation reference. \n2. ‘Compliance with all applicable maintenance and operational requirements’ means, in \nparticular, making an appropriate entry in the aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nor if applicable, in the aircraft technical log system, checking the compatibility of the component \nwith the aircraft approved design, including modifications, repairs, airworthiness directives, life \nlimitations and condition of the aircraft component plus information on where, when and why \nthe aircraft was grounded.

Working under the management system of an organisation appropriately approved under Part- \n145 (subcontracting) refers to the case of one organisation, whether or not it is approved under \nPart-145, that carries out certain maintenance (see paragraph 3.1) under the approval \ncertificate of a Part-145. In order to subcontract, the Part-145 organisation should have a \nprocedure for the control of such subcontractors as described below. Any approved \nmaintenance organisation that carries out maintenance under its own approval certificate for \nanother approved maintenance organisation is not considered to be subcontracted for the \npurpose of this paragraph, but contracted by that other organisation (see GM2 145.A.205). \n2. Maintenance of engines or engine modules other than ‘a complete workshop maintenance \ncheck or overhaul’ is intended to mean any maintenance that can be carried out without \ndisassembly of the core engine or, in the case of modular engines, without disassembly of any \ncore module. \n3. FUNDAMENTALS OF SUBCONTRACTING UNDER PART-145 \n3.1. The most common reasons for allowing an organisation approved under Part-145 to sub- \ncontract is to permit acceptance of certain maintenance tasks carried out by \nsubcontractors when approvals by the competent authority of those subcontractors are \nnot justified (e.g. limited scope of work, limited volume of maintenance activities, limited \nnumber of potential customers, limited need in time) or when the subcontractors cannot \ndemonstrate compliance with all elements of the regulation (e.g. no maintenance \nfacilities, specialised staff not covering all maintenance scope). \nThis subcontracting option permits the acceptance of the following maintenance: \n(a) specialised maintenance services, such as, but not limited to, surface treatment \n(e.g. plating, plasma spraying), fabrication of specified parts for repairs/ \nmodifications, welding, etc.; \n(b) aircraft maintenance (e.g. line maintenance, leaks detection in fuel tanks, special \nrepairs/modifications, complete aircraft painting) up to but not including a \ncomplete base maintenance check as specified in point 145.A.75(b); \n(c) component maintenance.; \n(d) engine maintenance up to but not including a complete workshop maintenance \ncheck or overhaul of an engine or engine module as specified in point 145.A.75(b). ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 428 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n3.2. When maintenance is carried out under the management system of a Part-145 \norganisation, it means that for the duration of such maintenance, the Part-145 approval \nhas been temporarily extended to include the subcontractor. It therefore follows that all \nparts of the subcontractor (facilities, personnel, equipment and tools, components, \nmaintenance data and procedures) involved with the maintenance organisation’s \nproducts undergoing maintenance should meet Part-145 requirements and the Part-145 \norganisation’s MOE for the duration of that maintenance, and it remains the Part-145 \norganisation’s responsibility to ensure such requirements are satisfied. \n3.3. When subcontracting, the Part-145 organisation is not required to have complete \nfacilities for the maintenance that it needs to sub-contract, but it should have its own \nexpertise to determine whether the \nsubcontractor meets the necessary standards. However, a Part-145 organisation cannot \nbe approved unless it has in-house the facilities, personnel, equipment and tools, \ncomponents, maintenance data, procedures and expertise to carry out the majority of \nthe maintenance for which it wishes to receive the terms of approval. \n3.4. The organisation may find it necessary to include specialised \nsubcontractors to enable it to be approved to issue the certificate of release to service of \na particular maintenance. Examples are provided in point 3.1(a). To authorise the use of \nsuch subcontractors, the competent authority will need to be satisfied that the Part-145 \norganisation has the necessary expertise and procedures to control such subcontractors. \n3.5. A maintenance organisation working outside the scope of its terms of approval is deemed \nto be not approved for the work considered. Such an organisation may in this \ncircumstance operate only as a subcontractor under the management system and control \nof another organisation appropriately approved under Part-145. \n3.6. Authorisation to sub-contract is indicated by the competent authority approving the MOE \ncontaining a specific procedure on the control of subcontractors as well as a list of \nsubcontractors. \n4. PART-145 PROCEDURES FOR THE CONTROL OF SUBCONTRACTORS \n4.1. A pre-audit procedure should be established whereby the Part-145 organisation should \naudit a prospective subcontractor to determine whether those services of the \nsubcontractor that it wishes to use meet the intent of Part-145. This audit should be \nperformed under the responsibility of the compliance monitoring function. \n4.2. The Part-145 organisation needs to assess to what extent it will use the subcontractor \nresources (facilities included). The contract between the Part-145 organisation and the \nsubcontractor will determine whether the Part-145 organisation requires its own \npaperwork, maintenance data and components to be used or, provided that they meet \nthe requirements of Part-145, if the facilities, equipment and tools from the \nsubcontractor will be used. In the case of \nsubcontractors who provide specialised services, it may for practical reasons be \nnecessary to use their specialised services paperwork, maintenance data and \ncomponents, subject to acceptance by the Part-145 organisation. \n4.3. Unless the sub-contracted maintenance work can be fully inspected on receipt by the \nPart-145 organisation, it will be necessary for the Part-145 organisation to establish an \nMOE procedure to control the subcontracted maintenance work (and associated \nsupporting documents). The organisation will need to consider whether to use its own \npersonnel or to authorise the subcontractor personnel for that control. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 429 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n4.4. The certificate of release to service may be issued either by subcontractor staff holding a \ncertification authorisation issued by the Part-145 organisation in accordance with points \n145.A.30 and 145.A.35 as appropriate, or by the Part-145 organisation certifying staff. \n4.5. The subcontractor control procedure will need to address the relevant management \nsystem key processes such as safety risk management and compliance monitoring (see \npoint 145.A.205). The procedure should ensure that records of all subcontractor audits \nand inspections, and the corresponding actions are kept, and provide information on \nwhen subcontractors are used. The procedure should include a clear revocation process \nfor subcontractors that do not meet the Part-145 maintenance organisation’s \nrequirements. \n4.6. The Part-145 compliance monitoring staff will need to audit the subcontractor control \nfunction of the Part-145 organisation and to audit the subcontractors unless this task is \nalready carried out by the subcontractor control function on behalf of the compliance \nmonitoring function. \n4.7. The contract between the Part-145 organisation and the \nsubcontractor should contain a provision to ensure that access to the subcontractor is \ngranted to any person authorised by the authorities specified in point 145.A.140. \n145.A.85 Changes to the organisation \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1963 \n(a) The following changes to the organisation shall require prior approval by the competent \nauthority: \n(1) changes to the certificate, including the terms of approval of the organisation; \n(2) changes of the persons referred to in points 145.A.30(a), (b), (c) and (ca); \n(3) changes to the reporting lines between the personnel nominated in accordance with \npoints 145.A.30(b), (c) and (ca), and the accountable manager; \n(4) the procedure as regards changes not requiring prior approval referred to in point (c); \n(5) additional locations of the organisation other than those that are subject to point \n145.A.75(c). \n(b) For the changes referred to in point (a) and for all other changes requiring prior approval in \naccordance with this Annex, the organisation shall apply for and obtain an approval issued by \nthe competent authority.

Establishing the root cause(s) often requires an \noverarching view of the events and circumstances that led to it, to identify all the possible \nsystemic and contributing factors (regulatory, technical, human factors, organisational factors, \netc.) in addition to the direct factors. \n(b) A narrow focus on single events or failures, or the use of a simple, linear model, such as a fault \ntree, to identify the chain of events that led to the non-compliance, may not properly reflect \nthe complexity of the issue, and therefore there is a risk that important factors that must be \naddressed in order to prevent a reoccurrence will be ignored. \nSuch an inappropriate or partial root cause analysis often leads to defining ‘quick fixes’ that only \naddress the symptoms of the non-conformity. A peer review of the results of the root cause \nanalysis may increase its reliability and objectivity. \n145.A.120 Means of compliance \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1963 \n(a) An organisation may use any alternative means of compliance to establish compliance with this \nRegulation. \n(b) If an organisation wishes to use an alternative means of compliance, it shall, prior to using it, \nprovide the competent authority with a full description. The description shall include any \nrevisions to manuals or procedures that may be relevant, as well as an explanation indicating \nhow compliance with this Regulation is achieved. \nThe organisation may use those alternative means of compliance subject to prior approval from \nthe competent authority. \nGM1 145.A.120 Means of compliance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nGENERAL \n(a) Acceptable means of compliance (AMC), as referred to in Article 76(3) of Regulation (EU) \n2018/1139, are a tool to standardise the demonstration of compliance and facilitate the \nverification activities of the competent authorities with Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 and its \ndelegated and implementing acts. They are published by the Agency to achieve these \nobjectives. Whereas the competent authorities and the regulated entities are not legally bound \nto use them, applying them is recommended. \n(b) If an organisation wishes to use means to comply with the Regulation different from the AMC \nestablished by EASA, that organisation may need to demonstrate compliance with Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1139 and its delegated and implementing acts by using alternative means of \ncompliance (AltMoC): \n(1) established by its competent authority — see GM1 145.B.120; or \n(2) established by that organisation and approved by its competent authority — see point \n(c) below.

Other organisations wishing to use the same means of compliance \nshould follow the AltMoC process (demonstrating compliance with the Regulation) and obtain \nindividual approval from their competent authority. \nGM2 145.A.120 Means of Compliance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nWHEN AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF COMPLIANCE IS NEEDED \nWhen there is no EASA AMC for a certain requirement in the Regulation, the means of compliance \nproposed by the organisation to that point of the Regulation do not need to go through the AltMoC \nprocess. It is the responsibility of the competent authority to verify that compliance with the \nRegulation is met. However, in certain cases the organisation may propose, and the competent \nauthority may agree, to have such means of compliance follow the AltMoC process. \nWhen there is an EASA AMC, the AltMoC process is needed in the following (not exhaustive) cases: \n− a means to comply with the Regulation is technically different in character to the AMC published \nby EASA; \n− A Form is significantly different from the one proposed in the EASA AMC. \nNote: A Form required by the delegated and implementing acts cannot be changed. \nExamples of issues not considered to require an AltMoC process include, but are not limited to: \n− editorial changes to an EASA AMC, as long as it does not change the intent of the AMC; \n— transposing an EASA AMC into the organisational structure, organisational processes, or \nstandard operating procedures with different wording and terminology customised to the \norganisation’s environment, if this does not change the intent of the AMC and its associated \nlevel of safety. \nAMC1 145.A.120(b) Means of compliance \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nDESCRIPTION SUPPORTING THE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF COMPLIANCE \n(a) The description of the AltMoC should include: \n− a summary of the AltMoC; \n− the content of the AltMoC; \n− a statement that compliance with the Regulation is achieved; and ",

Safety management enables an organisation to \nmanage its activities in a more systematic and focused manner. When an organisation has a clear \nunderstanding of its role and contribution to aviation safety, it can prioritise safety risks and more \neffectively manage their resources and obtain optimal results. \nThe principles of the requirements in points 145.A.200, 145.A.202, 145.A.205 and the related AMC \nconstitute the EU management system framework for aviation safety management. This framework \naddresses the core elements of the ICAO safety management system (SMS) framework defined in \nAppendix 2 to Annex 19, includes the elements of the compliance monitoring system, and promotes \nan integrated approach to the management of an organisation. It facilitates the introduction of the \nadditional safety management components, building upon the existing management system, rather \nthan adding them as a separate framework. \nThis approach is intended to encourage organisations to embed safety management and risk-based \ndecision-making into all their activities, instead of superimposing another system onto their existing \nmanagement system and governance structure. In addition, if the organisation holds multiple \norganisation certificates within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, it may choose to implement \na single management system to cover all of its activities. An integrated management system may not \nonly be used to capture management system requirements resulting from Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, \nbut also could cover other regulatory frameworks requiring compliance with Annex 19 or other \nbusiness management systems such as security, occupational health and environmental management \nsystems. Integration will remove any duplication and exploit synergies by managing safety risks across \nmultiple activities. Organisations may determine the best means to structure their management \nsystems to suit their business and organisational needs. \nThe core part of the management system framework (145.A.200) focuses on what is essential to \nmanage safety, by mandating the organisation to: \n(a) clearly define accountabilities and responsibilities; \n(b) establish a safety policy and the related safety objectives; \n(c) implement safety reporting procedures in line with just culture principles; \n(d) ensure the identification of aviation safety hazards entailed by its activities, ensure their \nevaluation, and the management of the associated risks, including: \n(1) taking actions to mitigate the risks; \n(2) verifying the effectiveness of the actions taken to mitigate the risks; \n(e) monitor compliance, while considering any additional requirements that are applicable to the \norganisation; ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 437 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(f) keep their personnel trained, competent, and informed about significant safety issues; and \n(g) document all the key management system processes. \nCompared with the previous Part-145 quality system ‘framework’ (now covered by point (b) and (e)), \nthe new elements that are introduced by the management system are, in particular, those addressed \nunder points (c) and (d). \nPoints (a), (b) and (g) address component 1 ‘Safety policy and objectives’ of the ICAO SMS framework. \nPoints (c) and (d)(1) address component 2 ‘Safety Risk Management’ of the ICAO SMS framework. \nPoint (d)(2) addresses component 3 ‘Safety Assurance’ of the ICAO SMS framework. Finally, point (f) \naddresses component 4 ‘Safety Promotion’ of the ICAO SMS framework. \nPoint 145.A.200 introduces the following as key safety management processes; these are further \nspecified in the related AMC and GM: \n− Hazard identification; \n− Safety risk management; \n− Internal investigation; \n− Safety performance monitoring and measurement; \n− Management of change; \n− Continuous improvement; \n− Immediate safety action and coordination with the aircraft operator’s Emergency Response \nPlan (ERP). \nIt is important to recognise that safety management will be a continuous activity, as hazards, risks and \nthe effectiveness of safety risk mitigations will change over time. \nThese key safety management processes are supported by a compliance monitoring function as an \nintegral part of the management system. Most aviation safety regulations constitute generic safety \nrisk controls established by the ‘regulator’. Therefore, ensuring effective compliance with the \nregulations during daily operations and independent monitoring of compliance are fundamental to \nany management system for safety. The compliance monitoring function may, in addition, support the \nfollow-up of safety risk mitigation actions. Moreover, where non-compliances are identified through \ninternal audits, the causes will be thoroughly assessed and analysed. Such an analysis in return \nsupports the risk management process by providing insights into causal and contributing factors, \nincluding human factors, organisational factors and the environment in which the organisation \noperates. In this way, the outputs of compliance monitoring become some of the various inputs to the \nsafety risk management functions. Conversely, the output of the safety risk management processes \nmay be used to determine focus areas for compliance monitoring. In this way, internal audits will \ninform the organisation’s management of the level of compliance within the organisation, whether \nsafety risk mitigation actions have been implemented, and where corrective or preventive action is \nrequired. The combination of safety risk management and compliance monitoring should lead to an \nenhanced understanding of the end-to-end process and the process interfaces, exposing \nopportunities for increased efficiencies, which are not limited to safety aspects. \nAs aviation is a complex system with many organisations and individuals interacting together, the \nprimary focus of the key safety management processes is on the organisational processes and \nprocedures, but it also relies on the humans in the system. The organisation and the way in which it \noperates can have a significant impact on human performance. Therefore, safety management ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 438 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nnecessarily addresses how humans can contribute both positively and negatively to an organisation’s \nsafety outcomes, recognising that human behaviour is influenced by the organisational environment. \nThe effectiveness of safety management largely depends on the degree of commitment of the senior \nmanagement to create a working environment that optimises human performance and encourages \npersonnel to actively engage in and contribute to the organisation’s management processes. Similarly, \na positive safety culture relies on a high degree of trust and respect between the personnel and the \nmanagement, and it must therefore be created and supported at the senior management level. If the \nmanagement does not treat individuals who identify hazards and report adverse events in a \nconsistently fair and just way, those individuals are unlikely to be willing to communicate safety issues \nor to work with the management to effectively address the safety risks. As with trust, a positive safety \nculture takes time and effort to establish, and it can be easily lost. \nIt is further recognised that the introduction of processes for hazard identification and risk \nassessment, mitigation and verification of the effectiveness of such mitigation actions will create \nimmediate and direct costs, while related benefits are sometimes intangible, and may take time to \nmaterialise. Over time, an effective management system will not only address the risks of major \noccurrences, but also identify and address production inefficiencies, improve communication, foster \na better organisational culture, and lead to a more effective control of contractors and suppliers. In \naddition, through an improved relationship with the authority, an effective management system may \nresult in a reduced oversight burden. \nThus, by viewing safety management and the related organisational policies and key processes as \nitems that are implemented not only to prevent incidents and accidents, but also to meet the \norganisation’s strategic objectives, any investment in safety should be seen as an investment in \nproductivity and organisational success. \nAMC1 145.A.200(a)(1) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nORGANISATION AND ACCOUNTABILITIES \n(a) The management system should encompass safety by including a safety manager and a safety \nreview board in the organisational structure. The functions of the safety manager are those \ndefined in AMC1 145.A.30(c);(ca). \n(b) Safety review board \n(1) The safety review board should be a high-level committee that considers matters of \nstrategic safety in support of the accountable manager’s safety accountability. \n(2) The board should be chaired by the accountable manager and composed of the person \nor group of persons nominated under points 145.A.30. \n(3) The safety review board should monitor: \n(i) the safety performance against the safety policy and objectives; \n(ii) that any safety action is taken in a timely manner; and \n(iii) the effectiveness of the organisation’s management system processes. \n(4) The safety review board may also be tasked with: \n(i) reviewing the results of compliance monitoring; \n(ii) monitoring the implementation of related corrective and preventive actions.

The creation of a positive \nsafety culture begins with the issuance of a clear, unequivocal policy. \n(b) The commitment to apply ‘just culture’ principles forms the basis for the organisation’s internal \nrules describing how ‘just culture’ principles are guaranteed and implemented. \n(c) For organisations that have their principal place of business in a Member State, Regulation (EU) \nNo 376/2014 defines the ‘just culture’ principles to be applied (refer in particular to \nArticle 16(11) of that Regulation). \nAMC1 145.A.200(a)(3) Management system \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nSAFETY MANAGEMENT KEY PROCESSES \n(a) Hazard identification processes \n(1) A reporting scheme should be the formal means of collecting, recording, analysing, acting \non, and generating feedback about hazards, events and the associated risks that may \naffect safety. \n(2) The hazards identification should include in particular: \n(i) hazards that may be linked to human factors issues that affect human \nperformance; and \n(ii) hazards that may stem from the organisational set-up or the existence of complex \noperational and maintenance arrangements (such as when multiple organisations \nare contracted, or when multiple levels of contracting/subcontracting are \nincluded). \n(b) Risk management processes \n(1) A formal safety risk management process should be developed and maintained that \nensures reactive, proactive and predictive approach composed by: \n(i) analysis (e.g. in terms of the probability and severity of the consequences of \nhazards and occurrences); \n(ii) assessment (in terms of tolerability); \n(iii) control (in terms of mitigation) of risks to an acceptable level. \nNote: The severity of the consequence should be evaluated to the best knowledge and \nengineering judgement of the organisation, and this evaluation may require collecting \ninformation from the competent authority, incident/accident investigation reports, the \ndesign approval holder, the declarant of a declaration of design compliance, etc. \n(2) The levels of management who have the authority to make decisions regarding the \ntolerability of safety risks, in accordance with (b)(1)(ii), should be specified. \n(c) Internal investigation \n(1) In line with its just culture policy, the organisation should define how to investigate \nincidents such as errors or near misses, in order to understand not only what happened, \nbut also how it happened, to prevent or reduce the probability and/or consequence of \nfuture recurrences (refer to AMC1 145.A.202). This approach should avoid concentrating \nthe analysis on who was (were) directly or indirectly concerned by the events. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 442 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(2) The scope of internal investigations should extend beyond the scope of the occurrences \nrequired to be reported to the competent authority in accordance with point 145.A.60, \nto include the reports referred to in 145.A.202(b). \n(d) Safety performance monitoring and measurement \n(1) Safety performance monitoring and measurement should be the processes by which the \nsafety performance of the organisation is verified in comparison with the safety policy \nand the safety objectives. \n(2) These processes may include, as appropriate to the size, nature and complexity of the \norganisation: \n(i) safety reporting, which may also address the status of compliance with the \napplicable requirements; \n(ii) safety reviews, including trend reviews, which would be conducted during the \nintroduction of new products and their components, new \nequipment/technologies, the implementation of new or changed procedures, or in \nsituations of organisational changes that may have an impact on safety; \n(iii) safety audits that focus on the integrity of the organisation’s management system, \nand on periodically assessing the status of safety risk controls; \n(iv) safety surveys, examining particular elements or procedures in a specific area, such \nas identified problem areas, or bottlenecks in daily maintenance activities, \nperceptions and opinions of maintenance management personnel, and areas of \ndissent or confusion; and \n(v) other indicators relevant to safety performance, which may be generated by \nautomated means. \n(e) Management of change \nChanges may introduce new hazards or threaten existing safety risk controls. The management \nof change should be a documented process established by the organisation to identify external \nand internal changes that may have an adverse effect on the safety of its maintenance activities. \nIt should make use of the organisation’s existing hazard identification, risk assessment and \nmitigation processes. \n(f) Continuous improvement \nThe organisation should continuously seek to improve its safety performance and the \neffectiveness of its management system. Continuous improvement may be achieved through: \n(1) audits carried out by external organisations; \n(2) assessments, including assessments of the effectiveness of the safety culture and \nmanagement system, in particular to assess the effectiveness of the safety risk \nmanagement processes; \n(3) staff surveys, including cultural surveys, that can provide useful feedback on how \nengaged personnel are with the management system; \n(4) monitoring the recurrence of incidents and occurrences; \n(5) evaluation of safety performance indicators and reviews of all the available safety \nperformance information; and \n(6) the identification of lessons learned.

These provisions are without \nprejudice to the occurrence reporting required by point 145.A.60. \n(2) If applicable, procedures should be implemented to enable the organisation to react \npromptly if the ERP is triggered by the operator and it requires the support of the Part-145 \norganisation. \nGM1 145.A.200(a)(3) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nSAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT — INTERFACES BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS \n(a) Safety risk management processes should specifically address the planned implementation of, \nor participation of the organisation in, complex operational and maintenance arrangements \n(such as when multiple organisations are contracted, or when multiple levels of \ncontracting/subcontracting are included). \n(b) Hazard identification and risk assessment start with the identification of all the parties involved \nin the arrangement, including independent experts and non-approved organisations. This \nidentification process extends to cover the overall control structure, and assesses in particular \nthe following elements across all subcontract levels and all parties within such arrangements: \n(1) coordination and interfaces between the different parties; \n(2) applicable procedures; \n(3) communication between all the parties involved, including reporting and feedback \nchannels; \n(4) task allocation, responsibilities and authorities; and \n(5) the qualifications and competency of key personnel with reference to point 145.A.30. \n(c) Safety risk management should focus on ensuring the following aspects: \n(1) clear assignment of accountability and allocation of responsibilities; \n(2) that only one party is responsible for a specific aspect of the arrangement, with no \noverlapping or conflicting responsibilities, in order to eliminate coordination errors; \n(3) the existence of clear reporting lines, both for occurrence reporting and progress \nreporting; \n(4) the possibility for staff to directly notify the organisation of any hazard that suggests an \nobviously unacceptable safety risk as a result of the potential consequences of this \nhazard. \n(d) The safety risk management processes should ensure that there is regular communication \nbetween all the parties involved to discuss work progress, risk mitigation actions, and changes \nto the arrangements, as well as any other significant issues.

    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 444 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nGM2 145.A.200(a)(3) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE \n(a) Unless they are properly managed, changes in organisational structure, facilities, the scope of \nwork, personnel, documentation, policies and procedures, etc. can result in the inadvertent \nintroduction of new hazards, and expose the organisation to new or increased risks. Effective \norganisations seek to improve their processes, with conscious recognition that changes can \nexpose the organisation to potentially latent hazards and risks if they are not properly and \neffectively managed. \n(b) Regardless of the magnitude of a change, large or small, its safety implications should always \nbe proactively considered. This is primarily the responsibility of the team that proposes and/or \nimplements the change. However, a change can only be successfully implemented if all the \npersonnel affected by the change are engaged, are involved and participate in the process. The \nmagnitude of a change, its safety criticality, and its potential impact on human performance \nshould be assessed in any change management process. \n(c) The process for the management of change typically provides principles and a structured \nframework for managing all aspects of the change. Disciplined application of the management \nof change can maximise the effectiveness of the change, engage the staff, and minimise the \nrisks that are inherent in a change. \n(d) The introduction of a change is the trigger for the organisation to perform their hazard \nidentification and risk management processes. \nSome examples of change include, but are not limited to: \n(1) changes to the organisational structure; \n(2) the inclusion of a new aircraft type in the terms of approval; \n(3) the addition of aircraft of the same or a similar type; \n(4) significant changes in personnel (affecting key personnel and/or large numbers of \npersonnel, high turnover); \n(5) new or amended regulations; \n(6) changes to the security arrangements; \n(7) changes in the economic situation of an organisation (e.g. commercial or financial \npressure); \n(8) new schedule(s), location(s), equipment, and/or operational procedures; and \n(9) the addition of new subcontractors. \n(e) A change may have the potential to introduce new, or to exacerbate pre-existing, human factors \nissues. For example, changes in computer systems, equipment, technology, personnel changes, \nincluding changes in management personnel, procedures, work organisation, or work processes \nare likely to affect performance. \n(f) The purpose of integrating human factors (HF) into the management of change is to minimise \npotential risks by specifically considering the impact of the change on the people within a \nsystem. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 445 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(g) Special consideration, including any HF issues, should be given to the ‘transition period’. In \naddition, the activities utilised to manage these issues should be integrated into the change \nmanagement plan. \n(h) Effective management of change should be supported by the following: \n(1) implementation of a process for formal hazard identification/risk assessment for major \noperational changes, major organisational changes, changes in key personnel, and \nchanges that may affect the way maintenance is carried out; \n(2) identification of changes that are likely to occur in business which would have a \nnoticeable impact on: \n(i) resources — material and human; \n(ii) management direction — policies, processes, procedures, training; and \n(iii) management control; \n(3) safety cases/risk assessments that are focused on aviation safety; \n(4) the involvement of key stakeholders in the change management process, as appropriate. \n(i) During the management of change process, previous risk assessments and existing hazards are \nreviewed for possible effect. \nAMC1 145.A.200(a)(4) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMMUNICATION ON SAFETY \n(a) The organisation should establish communication regarding safety matters that: \n(1) ensures that all personnel are aware of the safety management activities, as appropriate \nfor their safety responsibilities; \n(2) conveys safety-critical information, especially related to assessed risks and analysed \nhazards; \n(3) explains why particular actions are taken; and \n(4) explains why safety procedures are introduced or changed. \n(b) Regular meetings with personnel, at which information, actions, and procedures are discussed, \nmay be used to communicate safety matters. \nGM1 145.A.200(a)(4) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nSAFETY PROMOTION \n(a) Safety training, combined with safety communication and information sharing, forms part of \nsafety promotion. \n(b) Safety promotion activities should support: \n(1) the organisation’s policies, encouraging a positive safety culture, creating an \nenvironment that is favourable to the achievement of the organisation’s safety \nobjectives; \n(2) organisational learning; and ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 446 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(3) the implementation of an effective safety reporting scheme and the development of a \njust culture. \n(c) Depending on the particular safety issue, safety promotion may also constitute or complement \nrisk mitigation actions. \n(d) Qualifications and training aspects are further specified in the AMC and the GM to point \n145.A.30. \nGM1 145.A.200(a)(5) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION \n(a) The organisation may document its safety policy, safety objectives and all its key management \nsystem processes in a separate manual (e.g. a Safety Management Manual or Management \nSystem Manual), or in its MOE (see AMC1 145.A.70(a), Part 3 ‘Management system \nprocedures’). Organisations that hold multiple organisation certificates within the scope of \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1139 may prefer to use a separate manual in order to avoid duplication. \nThat manual or the MOE, depending on the case, should be the key instrument for \ncommunicating the approach to the management system for the whole of the organisation. \n(b) The organisation may also choose to document some of the information that is required to be \ndocumented in separate documents (e.g. policy documents, procedures). In that case, it should \nensure that the manual or the MOE contains adequate references to any document that is kept \nseparately. Any such documents are to be considered to be integral parts of the organisation’s \nmanagement system documentation. \nAMC1 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — GENERAL \n(a) The primary objectives of compliance monitoring are to provide an independent monitoring \nfunction on how the organisation ensures compliance with the applicable requirements, \npolicies and procedures, and to request action where non-compliances are identified. \n(b) The independence of the compliance monitoring should be established by always ensuring that \naudits and inspections are carried out by personnel who are not responsible for the functions, \nprocedures or products that are audited or inspected. \nAMC2 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — INDEPENDENT AUDIT \n(a) An essential element of the compliance monitoring function is the independent audit. \n(b) The independent audit should be an objective process of routine sample checks of all aspects \nof the organisation’s ability to carry out all maintenance to the standards required by this \nRegulation. It should include checking compliance of the organisation procedures with the \nRegulation, adherence of the organisation to these procedures, and product or maintenance \nsampling (i.e. product audit), as this is the end result of the maintenance process. ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 447 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(c) The independent audit should provide an objective overview of the complete set of \nmaintenance-related activities. It should include a percentage of unannounced audits carried \nout on a sample basis while maintenance is being carried out. This means that some audits \nshould be carried out during the night for those organisations that work at night. \n(d) The organisation should establish an audit plan to show when and how often the activities as \nrequired by this Regulation will be audited. \n(e) Except as specified in points (h) and (j), the audit plan should ensure that all aspects of Part-145 \ncompliance are verified every year, including all the subcontracted activities. The auditing may \nbe carried out as a complete single exercise or subdivided over the annual period. The \nindependent audit should not require each procedure to be verified against each product line \nwhen it can be shown that the particular procedure is common to more than one product line \nand the procedure has been verified every year without resultant findings. Where findings have \nbeen identified, compliance with the particular procedure should be verified against other \nproduct lines until the findings have been closed, after which the independent audit procedure \nmay revert back to a yearly interval for the particular procedure. \n(f) Except as specified otherwise in point (h), the independent audit should sample check one \nproduct (such as one aircraft or engine or component) while undergoing maintenance on each \nproduct line every year as a demonstration of compliance with the maintenance procedures \nand requirements associated with that specific product. This should include in particular the \nverification of: \n− the maintenance data and compliance with the organisation procedures, including \nconsideration of human factors issues; \n− the facility and maintenance environment; \n− the standard of inspection and precautions; \n− the completion of work cards/worksheet; \n− the tools and material; \n− the authorisation of the person carrying out maintenance. \nFor the purpose of this AMC, a product line includes any product under an Appendix II approval \nclass rating as specified in the terms of approval issued to the particular organisation. \nIt therefore follows, for example, that a Part-145 maintenance organisation approved to \nmaintain aircraft, engines, brakes and autopilots would need to carry out at least four complete \nproduct audits each year, except as specified otherwise in points (f), (h) or (j). \n(g) The product audit includes witnessing any relevant testing and visually inspecting the product \nand the associated documentation. The product audit should not involve repeated disassembly \nor testing unless the product audit identifies findings that require such an action. \n(h) Except as specified otherwise in point (j), where the organisation contracts the independent \naudit element of the compliance monitoring function in accordance with point (l), the audit \nshould be carried out twice every year. \n(i) Except as specified otherwise in point (j), where the organisation has line stations listed as per \npoint 145.A.75(d), the compliance monitoring documentation should include a description of \nhow these line stations are integrated into the monitoring and include a plan to audit each listed \nline station at a frequency consistent with the extent of flight activity at the particular line ",
    " \nAnnex II (Part-145) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL AND \nORGANISATION REQUIREMENTS  Page 448 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nstation and the related safety hazards identified. Except as specified otherwise in point (j), the \nmaximum period between audits of a particular line station should not exceed 2 years. \n(j) Except as specified otherwise in point (f), provided that there are no safety-related findings, the \naudit planning cycle specified in this AMC may be increased by up to 100 %, subject to a risk \nassessment and/or mitigation actions, and agreement by the competent authority. \n(k) A report should be issued each time an audit is carried out describing what was checked and \nthe resulting non-compliance findings against applicable requirement and procedures. \n(l) Organisations with a maximum of 10 maintenance staff actively engaged in carrying out \nmaintenance may subcontract the whole independent audit element of the compliance \nmonitoring function to another organisation or contract a qualified and competent person to \nbecome responsible for this element, with the agreement of the competent authority. \nThis does not prevent a larger organisation from occasionally using external support for \nconducting particular audits. \nAMC3 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — CONTRACTING OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDIT \n(a) If external personnel are used to perform independent audits: \n(1) any such audits should be performed under the responsibility of the compliance \nmonitoring manager; and \n(2) the organisation remains responsible for ensuring that the external personnel have the \nrelevant knowledge, background, and experience that are appropriate to the activities \nbeing audited, including knowledge and experience in compliance monitoring. \n(b) The organisation retains the ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness of the compliance \nmonitoring function, in particular for the effective implementation and follow-up of all \ncorrective actions. \nAMC4 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — FEEDBACK SYSTEM \n(a) Another essential element of the compliance monitoring function is the feedback system. \n(b) The feedback system should not be contracted to external persons or organisations. \n(c) When a non-compliance is found, the compliance monitoring function should ensure that the \nroot cause(s) and contributing factor(s) are identified (see GM1 145.A.95), and that corrective \nactions are defined. The feedback part of the compliance monitoring function should define \nwho is required to address any non-compliance in each particular case, and the procedure to \nbe followed if the corrective action is not completed within the defined time frame. The \nprincipal functions of the feedback system are to ensure that all findings resulting from the \nindependent audits of the organisation are properly investigated and corrected in a timely \nmanner, and to enable the accountable manager to be kept informed of safety issues and the \nextent of compliance with Part-145.

These target dates \nshould be discussed with the relevant department(s) before the compliance monitoring \nfunction confirms the dates in the report. The relevant department(s) is (are) required to \nimplement the corrective action and inform the compliance monitoring function of the status \nof the implementation of the action. \n(e) Unless the review of the results from compliance monitoring is given to the safety review board \n(ref. AMC1 145.A.200(a)(1) point (b)(4)), the accountable manager should hold regular meetings \nwith staff to check the progress of corrective actions. These meetings may be delegated to the \ncompliance monitoring manager on a day-to-day basis, provided that the accountable manager: \n(1) meets the senior staff involved at least twice per year to review the overall performance \nof the compliance monitoring function; and \n(2) receives at least a half-yearly summary report on non-compliance findings. \n(f) All records pertaining to the independent audit and the feedback system should be retained for \nthe period specified in point 145.A.55(c) or for such periods as to support changes to the audit \nplanning cycle in accordance with AMC2 145.A.200(a)(6), whichever is the longer. \nGM1 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING FUNCTION \nThe compliance monitoring function is one of the elements that is required to be in compliance with \nthe applicable requirements. This means that the compliance monitoring function itself should be \nsubject to independent monitoring of compliance in accordance with 145.A.200(a)(6). \nGM2 145.A.200(a)(6) Management system \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING — AUDIT PLAN \n(a) The purpose of this GM is to provide guidance on one acceptable working audit plan to meet \npart of the needs of point 145.A.200(a)(6). There is any number of other acceptable working \naudit plans. \n(b) The audits described in the audit plan are intended to monitor compliance with the applicable \nrequirements, and at the same time to review all areas of the organisation to which those \nrequirements are applicable. \n(c) In order to achieve this objective, as a first element, the organisation needs to identify all the \nregulatory requirements that are applicable to the activity and the scope of work under \nconsideration, to allow the audit plan to focus on the relevant topics. Each topic (e.g. facilities, \npersonnel, etc.) should be cross-referred with the relevant requirement and the related \nprocedure of the organisation in the exposition that describes the particular topic. If the \norganisation follows a specific means of compliance to demonstrate compliance with the rule, \nthat information may also be stated. \n(d) As a second element, all the functional areas of the organisation in which Part-145 functions \nare intended to be carried out (i.e. the types of maintenance-related activities), including \nsubcontracting, need to be listed in order to identify the applicability of any topic to each \nfunctional area.

The auditing entity should also \nbe aware of the risks and opportunities of the remote ICT used and the impacts they may have on the \nvalidity and objectivity of the information gathered. \nAudit reports and related records should indicate the extent to which remote ICT have been used in \nconducting remote audits and the effectiveness of remote ICT in achieving the audit objectives, \nincluding any item that has not been able to be completely reviewed.

In addition, the compliance monitoring \nfunction should at least check that the approval of the contracted maintenance organisation(s) \neffectively covers the contracted activities, and that it is still valid. \n(c) A Part-145 organisation is responsible for ensuring that interfaces and communication channels \nare established with the contracted maintenance organisation(s) for occurrence reporting. This \ndoes not replace the obligation of the contracted organisation(s) to report to the competent \nauthority in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. \nFor subcontracted activities, interfaces and communication channels are also needed for the \npurpose of the internal safety reporting scheme (145.A.202). \nGM2 145.A.205 Contracting and subcontracting \nED Decision 2022/011/R \nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN ‘CONTRACTING MAINTENANCE’ AND ‘SUBCONTRACTING MAINTENANCE’ \n(a) ‘Subcontracting maintenance’ means subcontracting to a third party under the maintenance \norganisation management system. \nThis is the case when a third party carries out certain maintenance tasks on behalf of the \nPart-145 organisation, and the responsibility remains with the Part-145 organisation (this Part- \n145 organisation must have the tasks within its scope of approval).

This situation could \ngenerate some consequences on the availability of tools and operational capabilities \nduring a peak of activities (ineffectiveness of the process). \n− The process to manage the tools control register through the dedicated software is not \ndetailed enough (potential to cause a level 2 finding). \n− The colour of the ‘unserviceable’ tag of the tools could generate some confusion. The \norganisation should consider changing the colour of this unserviceable tag to better alert \nthe staff on the particular status of the unserviceable tools (potential improvement). ",

An organisation must be granted terms of approval that range from a single class and \nrating with limitations to all classes and ratings with limitations. \n(b) In addition to the table in point (l), each maintenance organisation is required to indicate its \nscope of work in its MOE. \n(c) Within the approval class(es) and rating(s) established by the competent authority, the scope \nof work specified in the MOE defines the exact limits of its approval. It is therefore essential \nthat the approval class(es) and rating(s) and the organisation’s scope of work match. \n(d) A category A class rating means that the maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance \non aircraft and components (including engines and/or auxiliary power units (APUs)), in \naccordance with the aircraft maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, in \naccordance with the component maintenance data, only while such components are fitted to \nthe aircraft. Nevertheless, such an A-rated maintenance organisation may temporarily remove \na component for maintenance in order to improve access to that component, except when its \nremoval generates the need for additional maintenance that the organisation is not approved \nto perform. Such removal of component for maintenance by A-rated maintenance organisation \nshall be subject to an appropriate control procedure in the MOE. \nThe limitation column must specify the scope of such maintenance, thereby indicating the \nextent of the approval. \n(e) Category A class ratings are subdivided into “Base” or “Line” maintenance categories. Such an \norganisation may be approved for either “Base” or “Line” maintenance, or both. It should be \nnoted that a “Line” facility located at a main base facility requires a “Line” maintenance \napproval. \n(f) A category B class rating means that the maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance \non uninstalled engines and/or APUs and engine and/or APU components, in accordance with \nthe engine and/or APU maintenance data or, if agreed by the competent authority, in \naccordance with the component maintenance data, only while such components are fitted to \nthe engine and/or the APU. Nevertheless, such a B-rated approved maintenance organisation \nmay temporarily remove a component for maintenance in order to improve access to that \ncomponent, except when its removal generates the need for additional maintenance that the \norganisation is not approved to perform. \nThe limitation column must specify the scope of such maintenance, thereby indicating the \nextent of the approval. \nA maintenance organisation that is approved with a category B class rating may also carry out \nmaintenance on an installed engine during aircraft base and line maintenance, provided that an \nappropriate control procedure in the MOE has been approved by the competent authority. The \nscope of work in the MOE shall reflect those activities if they are permitted by the competent \nauthority. ",

The \nscope of work in the MOE shall reflect those activities if they are permitted by the competent \nauthority. \n(h) A category D class rating is a self-contained class rating that is not necessarily related to a \nspecific aircraft, engine or other component. The D1 – Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) rating is \nonly necessary for a maintenance organisation that carries out NDT as a particular task for \nanother organisation. A maintenance organisation that is approved with a class rating in the A, \nB or C category may carry out NDT on products that it maintains without the need for a D1 class \nrating provided that the MOE contains appropriate NDT procedures. \n(i) The limitation column is intended to give competent authorities the flexibility to customise an \napproval for any particular organisation. Ratings may only be mentioned on the approval if they \nare appropriately limited. The table in point (l) specifies the types of limitations that are \npossible. It is acceptable to stress in the limitation column the maintenance task rather than the \ntype or manufacturer of the aircraft or engine, if that is more appropriate to the organisation \n(an example could be avionics systems installations and the related maintenance). If that is \nmentioned in the limitation column, it indicates that the maintenance organisation is approved \nto carry out maintenance up to and including that particular type/task. \n(j) When reference is made to the series, type and group in the limitation column of class A and B, \nit shall be understood as follows: \n— “series” means a specific type series such as the Airbus 300, 310 or 319, or the Boeing \n737-300 series, the RB211-524 series, the Cessna 150 or Cessna 172, the Beech 55 series, \nthe continental O-200 series, etc., \n— “type” means a specific type or model such as the Airbus 310-240 type, the RB 211-524 \nB4 type, or the Cessna 172RG type. \nAny number of series or types may be quoted, \n— “group” means, for example, Cessna single piston engine aircraft or Lycoming non- \nsupercharged piston engines, etc. \n(k) By way of derogation from point 145.A.85(a)(1), when a component capability list is used that \ncould be subject to frequent amendments, then the organisation may propose to include such \namendments in the procedure referred to in point 145.A.85(c) for changes not requiring prior \napproval.

No interpretation of the test result or \ninterdependence of different values is allowed. \n− The test does not involve more than 10 actions as described in the approved maintenance \ndata (not including those required to configure the aircraft prior to the test, i.e. jacking, \nflaps down, etc, or to return the aircraft to its initial configuration). Pushing a control, \nswitch or button, and reading the corresponding outcome may be considered as a single \nstep even if the maintenance data shows them separated. \nTroubleshooting means the procedures and actions necessary, using approved maintenance \ndata, in order to identify the root cause of a defect or malfunction. It may include the use of \nBITE or external test equipment. \nLine maintenance: refer to AMC1 145.A.10 \nBase maintenance: refer to AMC1 145.A.10 \n2. The category B3 licence does not include any A subcategory. Nevertheless, this does not prevent \nthe B3 licence holder from releasing maintenance tasks typical of the A1.2 subcategory for \npiston-engine non-pressurized aeroplanes of 2 000 kg MTOM and below, within the limitations \ncontained in the B3 licence. \n3. The B1.2 and B3 licences do not include any L subcategory. Nevertheless, the holder of a B1.2 \nor B3 licence with the appropriate ratings is entitled to receive, upon application, licences in the \nL1 and L2 subcategories under the conditions described in point 66.B.110(d). \n4. The privileges of the B2 licence with given aircraft ratings include the privileges of the B2L \nlicence for all the system ratings for the same aircraft ratings. Nevertheless, the holder of a B2 \nlicence with given aircraft ratings may apply for a B2L licence in order to include a different \naircraft rating if the applicant only wants to demonstrate compliance with the experience \nrequirements for certain system ratings. \n5. The category C licence permits certification of base maintenance by the issue of a single \ncertificate of release to service for the complete aircraft after the completion of all such \nmaintenance. The basis for this certification is that the maintenance has been carried out by \ncompetent mechanics, and category B1, B2, B2L, B3 and L support staff, as appropriate, have \nsigned for the maintenance tasks under their respective specialisation. The principal function of \ncategory C certifying staff is to ensure that all required maintenance has been called up and \nsigned off by category B1, B2, B2L, B3 and L support staff, as appropriate, before issue of the \ncertificate of release to service. Only category C personnel who also hold category B1, B2, B2L, \nB3 or L qualifications may perform both roles in base maintenance. \nAMC 66.A.20(a)(4) Privileges \nED Decision 2019/009/R \n‘Within the limits of the system ratings specifically endorsed on the licence’ refers to the fact that the \nprivileges of the licence holder are limited: \n− to the group/subgroup of aircraft endorsed on the licence, but also \n− to the system rating(s) endorsed. ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 521 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nWhen an applicant wishes to get the privilege to issue certificates of release to service and to act as \nsupport staff for electrical and avionics tasks within powerplant and mechanical systems, he/she \nshould apply for the rating ‘airframe system’ on the B2L licence. The reason is that the ‘airframe \nsystems’ rating is the only rating which covers completely the electrical and avionics tasks of the \npowerplant and mechanical systems of the aircraft. \nAMC 66.A.20(b)(2) Privileges \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nThe 6 months of maintenance experience in the preceding 2-year period should be understood as \nconsisting of two elements, duration and nature of the experience. The minimum to meet the \nrequirements for these elements may vary depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft and \ntype of operation and maintenance. \n1. Duration: \nWithin an approved maintenance organisation: \n− 6 months of continuous employment within the same organisation; or \n− 6 months split up into different blocks, employed within the same or in different \norganisations. \nThe 6-month period can be replaced by 100 days of maintenance experience in accordance with \nthe privileges, whether they have been performed within an approved organisation or as \nindependent certifying staff according to M.A.801(b)1, or as a combination thereof. \nWhen a licence holder maintains and releases aircraft in accordance with M.A.801(b)1, in \ncertain circumstances this number of days may even be reduced by 50% when agreed in \nadvance by the competent authority. These circumstances consider the cases where the licence \nholder happens to be the owner of an aircraft and carries out maintenance on his/her own \naircraft, or where a licence holder maintains an aircraft operated for low utilisation, that does \nnot allow the licence holder to accumulate the required experience. This reduction should not \nbe combined with the 20% reduction permitted when carrying out technical support, or \nmaintenance planning, continuing airworthiness management or engineering activities. To \navoid a too long period without experience, the working days should be spread over the \nintended 6-month period. \n2. Nature of the experience: \nDepending on the category of the aircraft maintenance licence, the following activities are \nconsidered relevant for maintenance experience: \n− Servicing; \n− Inspection; \n− Operational and functional testing; \n− Trouble-shooting; \n− Repairing; \n− Modifying; \n− Changing component; \n− Supervising these activities; ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 522 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− Releasing aircraft to service. \nFor category A licence holders, the experience should include exercising the privileges, by \nmeans of performing tasks related to the authorization on at least one aircraft type for each \nlicence subcategory. This means tasks as mentioned in AMC 145.A.30(g), including servicing, \ncomponent changes and simple defect rectifications. \nFor category B1, B2, B2L, B3 and L, for every aircraft included in the authorisation the experience \nshould be on that particular aircraft or on a similar aircraft within the same licence \n(sub)category. Two aircraft can be considered to be similar when they have similar technology, \nconstruction and comparable systems, which means equally equipped with the following (as \napplicable to the licence category): \n− Propulsion systems (piston, turboprop, turbofan, turboshaft, jet-engine or push \npropellers); and \n− Flight control systems (only mechanical controls, hydro-mechanically powered controls \nor electro-mechanically powered controls); and \n− Avionic systems (analogue systems or digital systems); and \n− Structure (manufactured of metal, composite or wood). \nFor licences endorsed with (sub)group ratings: \n− In the case of a B1 licence endorsed with (sub)group ratings (either manufacturer sub- \ngroup or full (sub)group) as defined in 66.A.45, the holder should show experience on at \nleast one aircraft type per (sub)group and per aircraft structure (metal, composite, \nwood). \n− In the case of a B2 or B2L licence endorsed with (sub)group ratings (either manufacturer \nsubgroup or full (sub)group) as defined in 66.A.45, the holder should show experience on \nat least one aircraft type per (sub)group. \n− In the case of a B3 licence endorsed with the rating ‘piston-engine non-pressurised \naeroplanes of 2000 kg MTOM and below’ as defined in 66.A.45, the holder should show \nexperience on at least one aircraft type per aircraft structure (metal, metal-tubing with \nfabric, composite, wooden). \nFor category C, the experience should cover at least one of the aircraft types endorsed on the \nlicence. \nFor a combination of categories, the experience should include some activities of the nature \nshown in paragraph 2 in each category. \nA maximum of 20% of the experience duration required may be replaced by the following \nrelevant activities on an aircraft type of similar technology, construction and with comparable \nsystems: \n− Aircraft maintenance related training as an instructor/assessor or as a student; \n− Maintenance technical support/engineering; \n− Maintenance management/planning. \nThe experience should be documented in an individual log book or in any other recording \nsystem (which may be an automated one) containing the following data: \n− Date; ",

This supersedes the need for 6 months of \nexperience for the first 2 years. However, the requirement of 6 months of experience in the preceding \n2 years will need to be met after the second year. \nAMC 66.A.20(b)3 Privileges \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nThe wording ‘has the adequate competence to certify maintenance on the corresponding aircraft’ \nmeans that the licence holder and, if applicable, the organisation where he/she is \ncontracted/employed, should ensure that he/she has acquired the appropriate knowledge, skills, \nattitude and experience to release the aircraft being maintained. This is essential because some \nsystems and technology present in the particular aircraft being maintained may not have been \ncovered by the training/examination/experience required to obtain the licence and ratings. \nThis is typically the case, among others, in the following situations: \n− Type ratings which have been endorsed on a licence in accordance with Appendix I to AMC to \nPart-66 ‘List of Type Ratings’ after attending type training/on-the-job training which did not \ncover all the models/variants included in such rating. For example, a licence endorsed with the \nrating Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56) after attending type training/on-the-job training \ncovering only the Airbus 320 (CFM56). \n− Type ratings which have been endorsed on a licence in accordance with Appendix I to AMC to \nPart-66 ‘List of Type Ratings’ after a new variant has been added to the rating in Appendix I, \nwithout performing difference training. For example, a licence endorsed with the rating Boeing \n737-600/700/800/900 for a person who already had the rating Boeing 737-600/700/800, \nwithout performing any difference training for the 737-900. \n− Work being carried out on a model/variant for which the technical design and maintenance \ntechniques have significantly evolved from the original model used in the type training/on-the- \njob training. ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 524 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− Specific technology and options selected by each customer which may not have been covered \nby the type training/on-the-job training. \n− Changes in the basic knowledge requirements of Appendix I to Part-66 not requiring re- \nexamination of existing licence holders (grandfathered privileges). \n− The endorsement of group/subgroup ratings based on experience on a representative number \nof tasks/aircraft or based on type training/examination on a representative number of aircraft. \n− Persons meeting the requirements of 6 months of experience every 2 years only on certain \nsimilar aircraft types as allowed by AMC 66.A.20(b)2. \n− Persons holding a Part-66 licence with limitations, obtained through conversion of national \nqualifications (66.A.70), where such limitations are going to be lifted after performing the \ncorresponding basic knowledge examinations. In this case, the type ratings endorsed in the \nlicence may have been obtained in the national system without covering all the aircraft systems \n(because of the previous limitations) and there will be a need to assess and, if applicable, to \ntrain this person on the missing systems. \nAdditional information is provided in AMC 145.A.35(a). \nGM 66.A.20(b)4 Privileges \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1. Holders of a Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence may not exercise certification privileges unless \nthey have a general knowledge of the language used within the maintenance environment \nincluding knowledge of common aeronautical terms in the language. The level of knowledge \nshould be such that the licence holder is able to: \n− read and understand the instructions and technical manuals used for the performance of \nmaintenance; \n− make written technical entries and any maintenance documentation entries, which can \nbe understood by those with whom they are normally required to communicate; \n− read and understand the maintenance organisation procedures; \n− communicate at such a level as to prevent any misunderstanding when exercising \ncertification privileges. \n2. In all cases, the level of understanding should be compatible with the level of certification \nprivileges exercised. \n66.A.25 Basic knowledge requirements \nRegulation (EU) 2023/989 \n(a) The applicant for an aircraft maintenance licence shall demonstrate by examination a level of \nknowledge of the related subject modules in accordance with Appendix I (applicable to category \nA, B1, B2, B2L, B3 and C licences) or Appendix VII (applicable to category L licences). \n(b) The basic knowledge examinations shall comply with the standard set out in Appendix II \n(applicable to category A, B1, B2, B2L, B3 and C licences) or Appendix VIII (applicable to category \nL licences) to this Annex and shall be conducted by either of the following: \n(1) a training organisation approved in accordance with Annex IV (Part-147); \n(2) the competent authority; ",

Maintenance experience on operating aircraft: \n− means the experience of being involved in maintenance tasks on aircraft which are being \noperated by airlines, air taxi organisations, aero clubs, owners, etc., as relevant to the \nlicence category/subcategory; \n− should cover a wide range of tasks in terms of length, complexity and variety; \n− aims at gaining sufficient experience in the real environment of maintenance as opposed \nto only the training school environment; \n− may be gained within different types of maintenance organisations (Part-145, M.A. \nSubpart F, Part-CAO, FAR-145, etc.) or under the supervision of independent certifying \nstaff; \n− may be combined with Part-147 approved training (or other training approved by the \ncompetent authority) so that periods of training can be intermixed with periods of \nexperience, similar to an apprenticeship; \n− may be full-time or part-time, either as a professional or on a voluntary basis; ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 529 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− in the case of the L licence, it is acceptable that the 1 or 2 years of experience required \nby 66.A.30(a)(2b) covers maintenance performed only during the weekends (or \nequivalent periods) as long as the applicant has achieved a sufficient level of competency \nrelated to the applicable licence subcategory as attested by the corresponding \nstatement(s) issued by the maintenance organisation(s) or independent certifying staff \nthat supervised the applicant. \n2. A skilled worker is a person who has successfully completed a training, acceptable to the \ncompetent authority, involving the manufacture, repair, overhaul or inspection of mechanical, \nelectrical or electronic equipment. The training would include the use of tools and measuring \ndevices. \n3. In the case of an applicant for a licence, including several categories/subcategories, it is \nacceptable to combine the periods of experience as long as there is sufficient experience for \neach category/subcategory during the required period. Examples: \n− Application for a B1.1 (turbine aeroplanes) + B1.3 (turbine helicopters): the Regulation \nrequires 5 years of experience for B1.1 and 5 years of experience for B1.3 for an applicant \nwith no relevant previous technical training. \n− It is not acceptable to combine the experience in a single 5-year period where the \napplicant has been working for 3 years on turbine aeroplanes and 2 years on \nturbine helicopters. \n− However, it is acceptable to combine the experience in a single 5-year period if the \napplicant has been working for 5 years on turbine aeroplanes and turbine \nhelicopters (for example, aeroplanes in the morning, helicopters in the afternoon, \nor a few days every week on aeroplanes and a few days every week on helicopters). \n− Application for a B1.1 (turbine aeroplanes) + B2 (avionics): the Regulation requires 5 years \nof experience for B1.1 and 5 years of experience for B2 for an applicant with no relevant \nprevious technical training. \n− It is not acceptable to combine the experience in a single 5-year period where the \napplicant has been working for 3 years on turbine aeroplanes (with no avionics \nwork) and 2 years on avionics systems. \n− However, it is acceptable to combine the experience in a single 5-year period if the \napplicant has been working for 5 years on structures, powerplant, mechanical and \nelectrical systems and avionics (for B1.1 tasks in the morning, B2 tasks in the \nafternoon, or a few days every week for B1.1 tasks and a few days every week for \nB2 tasks). \n− Application for a B1.1, B1.2, B1.3, B1.4 and B2: the Regulation requires 5 years of \nexperience for B1.1, B1.3 and B2, and 3 years of experience for B1.2 and B1.4 for an \napplicant with no relevant previous technical training. \n− In this case, it is very unlikely that the experience for each category/subcategory \nwould be sufficient. \n4.

Such group standards may include \nprovisions for the monitoring of the obligations of the parties that have signed the contract \nestablished in accordance with Appendix I to Annex I (Part-M) to Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. \n(b) The group management board or similar group governance body is composed of the \naccountable managers of the organisations and a coordinating member. The names of the \nboard members are included directly, or by reference to a common document, in the contract, \nand are updated in the respective document in case of change in personnel. \n(c) The coordinating member may be one of the accountable managers or another person. As a \nconsequence of applying point M.A.201(ea) is that several operators will use the same CAMO, \nthe group management board may consider having as coordinating member one employee of \nthat CAMO. The role of the coordinating member includes, but is not limited to the following: \n− ensuring that all perspectives are considered; \n− defining the by-laws of the board and ensuring they are complied with; \n− coordinating decision-making; \n− ensuring that the documentation is updated; \n− ensuring the review of the group standards; \n− ensuring the regular exchange of communication and that meetings take place; and \n− coordinating the integration of an organisation into, or, if applicable, its departure from, \nthe business grouping.

For the granting of manufacturer subgroup ratings for Group 2 aircraft, for B1 and C licence \nholders, the sentence ‘at least two aircraft types from the same manufacturer which combined \nare representative of the applicable manufacturer subgroup’ means that the selected aircraft \ntypes should cover the technologies relevant to the manufacturer subgroup in the following \nareas: \n− Flight control systems (mechanical controls/hydromechanically powered controls / \nelectromechanically powered controls); and \n− Avionic systems (analogue systems / digital systems); and \n− Structure (manufactured of metal / composite / wood). \nIn cases where there are very different aircraft types within the same manufacturer subgroup, \nit may be necessary to cover more than two aircraft types to ensure adequate representation. \nFor this purpose it may be possible to use aircraft types from the same manufacturer classified \nin Group 1 as long as the selected aircraft belong to the same licence subcategory for which the \nrating will be endorsed. \n2. For the granting of full subgroup ratings for Group 2 aircraft, for B1 and C licence holders, the \nsentence ‘at least three aircraft types from different manufacturers which combined are \nrepresentative of the applicable subgroup’ means that the selected aircraft types should cover \nall the technologies relevant to the manufacturer subgroup in the following areas: \n− Flight control systems (mechanical controls/hydromechanically powered controls / \nelectromechanically powered controls); and \n− Avionic systems (analogue systems / digital systems); and \n− Structure (manufactured of metal / composite / wood). \nIn cases where there are very different aircraft types within the same subgroup, it may be \nnecessary to cover more than three aircraft types to ensure adequate representation. \nFor this purpose it may be possible to use aircraft types from different manufacturers classified \nin Group 1 as long as the selected aircraft belong to the same licence subcategory for which the \nrating will be endorsed. \n3. For manufacturer subgroup ratings, the term ‘manufacturer’ means the TC holder defined in \nthe certification data sheet, which is reflected in the list of type ratings in Appendix I to AMC to \nPart-66. \nIn the case of an aircraft rating where the type rating refers to a TC holder made of a \ncombination of two manufacturers which produce a similar aircraft (i.e. AGUSTA / BELL \nHELICOPTER TEXTRON or any case of aircraft similarly built by another manufacturer) this \ncombination should be considered as one manufacturer. \nAs a consequence: \n− When a licence holder gets a manufacturer type or a manufacturer subgroup rating made \nof a combination of manufacturers, it covers the combination of such manufacturers. \n− When a licence holder who intends to endorse a full subgroup rating selects three aircraft \nfrom different manufacturers, this means from different combinations of manufacturers \nas applicable.

All those undertakings are \nlocated in the territory to which the Treaties apply. \nThe controlling undertaking exercises directly or indirectly a dominant influence over the \ncontrolled undertaking by virtue of ownership, financial participation, right to appoint \nmanagement or a supervisory body, the rules that govern it, or other. \nThe controlled and controlling undertakings include air carriers licensed in accordance with \nRegulation (EC) 1008/2008 \n1 \nas well as one or more organisations that are approved in \naccordance with Annex Vc (Part-CAMO) to Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. \nIn the frame of Community-scale groups of undertakings, Article 3 of Directive 2009/38/EC \n2 \nprovides additional information about controlling undertakings, which can also be suitable to \nnational-scale groups of undertakings. \n(b) Each approved organisation is responsible for its management system, even if they follow \ncommon group standards, policies, or procedures. The accountability of each approved \norganisation, as defined by the relevant EU regulation, is not affected by being part of a single \nair carrier business grouping. The air carrier remains ultimately responsible for the continuing \nairworthiness of the aircraft it operates even if the operator decides to contract the continuing \nairworthiness management to a CAMO.

The ratings on these licences can only be obtained after demonstration of the appropriate \nexperience representative of the full scope of the licence subcategory. \n66.A.50 Limitations \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1142 \n(a) Limitations introduced on an aircraft maintenance licence are exclusions from the certification \nprivileges and, in the case of limitations referred to in point 66.A.45, they affect the aircraft in \nits entirety. \n(b) For limitations referred to in point 66.A.45, limitations shall be removed upon: \n1. demonstration of appropriate experience; or \n2. after a satisfactory practical assessment performed by the competent authority. \n(c) For limitations referred to in point 66.A.70, limitations shall be removed upon satisfactory \ncompletion of examination on those modules/subjects defined in the applicable conversion \nreport referred to in point 66.B.300. \nAMC 66.A.50(b) Limitations \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. The appropriate experience required to remove the limitations referred to in 66.A.45(f),(g) and \n(h) should consist of the performance of a variety of tasks appropriate to the limitations under \nthe supervision of authorised certifying staff. This should include the tasks required by a \nscheduled annual inspection. Alternatively, this experience may also be gained, if agreed by the \ncompetent authority, by theoretical and practical training provided by the manufacturer, as \nlong as an assessment is further carried out and recorded by this manufacturer. \n2. It is acceptable to have this experience in just one aircraft type, provided this type is \nrepresentative of the (sub)group in relation to the limitation being removed. \n3. It is acceptable that this experience is gained in aircraft not covered by the Basic Regulation, \nprovided that this experience is relevant and representative of the corresponding (sub)group. \nAn example could be the experience required to remove a limitation such as ‘aircraft with metal \ntubing structure covered with fabric’, which may be gained in ultralight aircraft (Annex I \naircraft). \n4. The application for the limitation removal should be supported by a record of experience signed \nby the authorised certifying staff or by an assessment signed by the manufacturer after \ncompletion of the applicable theoretical and practical training.

The holder of a \ncertifying staff qualification gained following such process shall be issued an aircraft \nmaintenance licence by the competent authority of this Member State without further \nexamination subject to the conditions specified in Section B Subpart D. \n(c) Where necessary, the aircraft maintenance licence shall contain limitations in accordance with \npoint 66.A.50 to reflect the differences between: \n(i) the scope of the certifying staff qualification valid in the Member State before the entry \ninto force of the applicable licence category or subcategory provided for in this Annex \n(Part-66); \n(ii) the basic knowledge requirements and the basic examination standards laid down in \nAppendices I and II to this Annex (Part-66). \n(d) By derogation from point (c), for aircraft not used by licenced air carriers in accordance with \nRegulation (EC) No 1008/2008, other than complex motor-powered aircraft, and for balloons, \nsailplanes, motor-powered sailplanes and airships, the aircraft maintenance licence shall \ncontain limitations in accordance with point 66.A.50 to ensure that the certifying staff privileges \nvalid in the Member State before the entry into force of the applicable Part-66 licence \ncategory/subcategory and those of the converted Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence remain \nthe same. \nGM 66.A.70 Conversion provisions \nED Decision 2019/009/R \n1. As described in point 66.A.70, the conversion provisions apply to the holder of a certifying staff \nqualification valid in a Member State prior to the date of entry into force of Annex III (Part-66). \nThe sentence ‘the holder of a certifying staff qualification valid in a Member State’ means any \nperson who had a qualification valid in that Member State allowing that person the \nperformance of activities identical to the privileges of ‘certifying staff’ contained in Regulation \n(EU) 1321/2014. This means that the signature of that person was sufficient to declare that the \nmaintenance had been properly performed and the aircraft was ready for service and fit for \nflight in respect to such maintenance. \nThis should not been mistaken with the responsibilities linked to the airworthiness review, \nwhich was performed at different periods (typically varying from 6 months to 3 years) in the \nnational systems. This is an activity which is performed at very specific points of time and not \nafter every maintenance activity. Since an airworthiness review (or equivalent term used in the ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 542 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nnational systems) is not performed after every maintenance event before the aircraft takes \nflight, an airworthiness review cannot be considered as a maintenance release. This means that \nthe conversion provisions described in 66.A.70 are not applicable to persons performing \nairworthiness review functions unless their signature was required after every maintenance \nevent before the aircraft can take flight. \n2. The conversion applies to ‘certifying staff qualifications’ such as, for example: \n− holding a national licence (or completed the process to obtain such a national licence); \n− having completed a qualification process defined by the competent authority, or \nequivalent body under the national system, to become certifying staff; \n− having completed the qualification requirements for certifying staff within a maintenance \norganisation, as defined in their procedures. \nThis does not mean that in order to be entitled to a conversion process, the applicant has to be \nexercising certification privileges. A person may hold a ‘certifying staff qualification’ while not \nhaving certification privileges (or while exercising very limited certification privileges below \nhis/her qualification) for different reasons such as, for example, the following: \n− The person is working as ‘support staff’ in the base maintenance environment; \n− The person has been authorised only for a very limited range of tasks (lower than what \nhe/she would be entitled if his/her qualification is considered) since the person is working \nin a line station where the scope of tasks is very limited; \n− The person holds a licence with a wider scope than the scope of the organisation where \nhe/she is employed; \n− The person is working outside the aviation industry or is temporarily on leave due to \ndifferent reasons (medical, personal, etc). \nThese persons are entitled to have the conversion performed in accordance with the full scope \nof their qualification and the full privileges that they would be entitled to hold on the basis of \nsuch qualification. \n3. As described in point 66.A.70, certifying staff qualifications eligible for conversion are those \nvalid ‘prior to the date of entry into force of Annex III (Part-66)’, which means those \nqualifications valid before the following dates: \n− 28 September 2005 for aircraft above 5 700 kg MTOM; \n− 28 September 2006 for aircraft of 5 700 kg MTOM and below. \nNevertheless, since the B3, B2L and L licences did not exist at those dates, certifying staff \nqualifications eligible for conversion to a B3, B2L and L licence are those valid before the \ncompetent authority had the obligation to start issuing such licences, which means the \nfollowing: \n− for the B3 licence, those qualifications valid before 28 September 2012; \n− for the B2L licence, those qualifications valid before 5 March 2019; \n− for the L licence, those qualifications valid before 1 October 2019. \n4. Although only those certifying staff qualifications gained prior to the dates indicated above are \neligible for conversion, this does not mean that the application for conversion has to be ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 543 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nsubmitted prior to those dates. The applicant is entitled to have the conversion performed \nirrespective of when he/she applies for conversion. \n5. A certifying staff qualification can be subject to more than one conversion process and can also \nbe converted to more than one licence (sub)category (with any applicable limitations). This \ncould be the case, for example, of a person who already had the certifying staff qualification \nconverted in the past to a B1.2 licence with limitations linked to some missing elements of the \nPart-66 Appendix I and II standard (following 66.A.70(c)). This person would be entitled to apply \nand have his/her certifying staff qualification converted to a B1.2 or a B3 or L licence on the \nbasis of 66.A.70(d), which would mean no need to compare with the Part-66 Appendix I, II or \nVII standard, introducing only those limitations required in order to maintain the existing \nprivileges. \nGM 66.A.70(c) Conversion provisions \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nFor example, a limitation could be where a person holds a pre-existing certifying staff qualification \nwhich covered, to the standard of Part-66 Appendix I and II, all the modules/subjects corresponding \nto the B1 licence except for electrical power systems. This person would be issued a Part-66 aircraft \nmaintenance licence in the B1 category with a limitation (exclusion) on electrical power systems. \nFor removal of limitations, refer to 66.A.50(c). \nGM 66.A.70(d) Conversion provisions \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nFor aircraft not used by air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 other \nthan complex motor-powered aircraft, an example of limitations could be where a person holds a pre- \nPart-66 qualification which covered privileges to release work performed on aircraft structures, \npowerplant, mechanical and electrical systems but excluded privileges on aircraft equipped with \nturbine engine, aircraft above 2 000 kg MTOM, pressurised aircraft and aircraft equipped with \nretractable landing gear. This person would be issued with a Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence in \nthe B1.2 or B3 (sub)category with the following limitations (exclusions): \n− aircraft used by air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 (this \nlimitation always exists); \n− aircraft above 2 000 kg MTOM; \n− pressurised aircraft; \n− aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear. \nAnother example of limitations could be where a pilot-owner holds a pre-Part-66 qualification which \ncovered privileges to release work performed on aircraft structures, powerplant, mechanical and \nelectrical systems but limited to their own aircraft and limited to a particular aircraft type (for example, \na Cessna 172). This pilot-owner would receive a Part-66 aircraft maintenance licence in the B1.2 or B3 \n(sub)category with the following limitations (exclusions): \n− aircraft used by air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 (this \nlimitation always exists); \n− aircraft other than a Cessna 172; \n− aircraft not owned by the licence holder. ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 544 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nOne more example would be the case where a person holds a pre-Part-66 qualification that covers \nprivileges to release work on composite and metal sailplanes and powered sailplanes, covering aircraft \nstructures, powerplant, mechanical and electrical systems. This person would be issued a Part-66 \naircraft maintenance licence in the L2 subcategory, with the following limitations (exclusions): \n− ELA1 aeroplanes; \n− wooden-structure aircraft covered with fabric; \n− aeroplanes with metal-tubing structure covered with fabric. \nAnd one more example would be the case where a person holds a pre-Part-66 qualification that covers \nprivileges to release work on composite sailplanes up to the annual inspection but not including \ncomplex maintenance tasks, repairs and changes. This person would be issued a Part-66 aircraft \nmaintenance licence in the L1C subcategory, with the following limitations: \n− complex maintenance tasks described in Appendix VII to Annex I (Part-M), standard changes \ndescribed in point 21.A.90B of Part 21 or points 21L.A.62 or 21L.A.102 of Part 21 Light, and \nstandard repairs described in point 21.A.431B of Part 21 or points 21L.A.202 or 21L.A.222 of \nPart 21 Light. \nThe essential aspect is that the limitations are established in order to maintain the privileges of the \npre-Part-66 qualification without comparing the previous qualification with the standard of Part-66 \nAppendix I and II. \nFor removal of limitations, refer to 66.A.50(c).

Questions may be prepared in the national language but the use of aviation English is \nrecommended wherever possible. \n2. The primary purpose of essay questions is to determine that the candidate can express \nthemselves in a clear and concise manner and can prepare a concise technical report for the \nmaintenance record, which is why only a few essay questions are required. \n3. Oral type questions may not be used as the primary means of examination because of the \ndifficulty in establishing consistency of standards between examiners or day-to-day. \nHowever, nothing prevents the competent authority from meeting potential certifying staff for \nthe purpose of ensuring they understand their obligations and responsibilities in the application \nof maintenance Parts. \n4. For pass mark purposes, the essay questions should be considered as separate from the multiple \nchoice questions. \n5. Multiple choice question (MCQ) generation. \nThe following principles should be observed when developing multiple choice question: \n(a) The examination should measure clearly formulated goals. Therefore the field and depth \nof knowledge to be measured by each question should be fully identified. \n(b) All the questions should be of the multiple choice type with three alternative answers. \n(c) Questions that require specialised knowledge of specific aircraft types should not be \nasked in a basic licence examination. \n(d) The use of abbreviations and acronyms should generally be avoided. However where \nneeded, only internationally recognised abbreviations and acronyms should be used. In \ncase of doubt use the full form, e.g. angle of attack = 12 degrees instead of a= 12°. \n(e) Questions and answers should be formulated as simply as possible: the examination is \nnot a test of language. Complex sentences, unusual grammar and double negatives \nshould be avoided. \n(f) A question should comprise one complete positive proposition. No more than 3 different \nstatements should appear among the suggested responses otherwise the candidate may \nbe able to deduce the correct answer by eliminating the unlikely combinations of \nstatements. \n(g) Questions should have only one true answer. \n(h) The correct answer should be absolutely correct and complete or, without doubt, the \nmost preferable. Responses that are so essentially similar that the choice is a matter of \nopinion rather than a matter of fact should be avoided. The main interest in MCQs is that \nthey can be quickly performed: this is not achieved if doubt exists about the correct \nanswer. \n(i) The incorrect alternatives should seem equally plausible to anyone ignorant of the \nsubject. All alternatives should be clearly related to the question and of similar \nvocabulary, grammatical structure and length. In numerical questions, the incorrect \nanswers should correspond to procedural errors such as corrections applied in the wrong \nsense or incorrect unit conversions: they should not be mere random numbers.

    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nSECTION B — PROCEDURES FOR \nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES  Page 561 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− The question should be relevant to the category and level of difficulty listed in the \nsyllabus, e.g. a description of a typical general aviation system may not be \nacceptable for a typical commercial aeroplane. \n− Subject to obvious constraints in relation to the topic being addressed the question \nshould have a strong bias towards the practical maintenance of a \nsystem/component and the answer should show an understanding of normal and \ndeteriorated conditions of an aircraft and its systems. \nVariations on alternative possible answers which have not been thought of, may \nhave to be taken into account to aid the examiner when marking. If considered \nrelevant, the model answer should be amended to include these new points. \n(e) Because of the difficulty in marking an essay answer using key points only, there is a need \nfor the way in which the report was written to be assessed and taken into consideration. \n(f) The total points for each question will add up to 100 and will need to reflect both the \ncombination of the technical (key point) element and the report style element. \n(g) Each key point will be graded upon its importance and have point weighting allocated to \nit. The total weight will represent 60% of the mark. \n(h) Key points are the ‘important elements’ that may be knowledge or experience-based and \nwill include other maintenance orientated factors such as relevant safety precautions or \nlegislative practices if applicable. Excessive reference to the need for MM referral or \nsafety checks may be considered wasteful. \n(i) The question answer will be analysed for the clarity and manner in which the essay report \nis presented and have a weighting allocated to it which will represent 40% of the mark. \n(j) The answer should show the candidate's ability to express himself in technical language. \nThis includes readability of the language, basic grammar and use of terminology. \n(k) The report starts in the beginning and has logical process to reach a conclusion. \n(l) Supporting diagrams should not be encouraged but if used should supplement the \nanswer and not replace the need for a broad text answer. \n(m) The report should not be indexed, itemised or listed. \n(n) Within reason the candidate should not be penalised for incorrect spelling. \n(o) A zero mark should only be given in exceptional circumstances. Even if the student \nmisunderstands the question and gives an answer to a different question, a sympathetic \nmark even if only for the report style should be given, this could up to the maximum \npercentage allowed. \n(p) The two allocated marks should be added together and written into the answer paper. \n(q) If a question answer resulting in a borderline failure is principally due to ‘written report \nerrors,’ the paper should be discussed and the mark agreed if possible with another \nexaminer.

Alternatively to this pre-flight assessment, \nwhen the type of aircraft and nature of operations allow for it, the build-up of residues \nmay be controlled through scheduled maintenance inspections/cleanings identified in \nthe approved maintenance programme. \n2. Tasks such as oil and hydraulic fluid uplift and tyre inflation may be considered as part of the \npre-flight inspection. The related pre-flight inspection instructions should address the \nprocedures to determine where the necessary uplift or inflation results from an abnormal \nconsumption and possibly requires additional maintenance action by the approved \nmaintenance organisation or certifying staff as appropriate. \n3. In the case of air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, the CAMO \nshould publish guidance to maintenance and flight personnel and any other personnel \nperforming pre-flight inspection tasks, as appropriate, defining responsibilities for these actions \nand, where tasks are contracted to other organisations, how their accomplishment is subject to \nthe quality system of M.A.712 or the management system required by CAMO.A.200. It should \nbe demonstrated to the competent authority that pre-flight inspection personnel have received \nappropriate training for the relevant pre-flight inspection tasks. The training standard for \npersonnel performing the pre-flight inspection should be described in the continuing \nairworthiness management exposition. \nAMC M.A.301(b) Continuing airworthiness tasks \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n1. The operator should have a system to ensure that all defects affecting the safe operation of the \naircraft are rectified within the limits prescribed by the approved minimum equipment list \n(MEL), configuration deviation list (CDL) or maintenance data, as appropriate. Also that such \ndefect rectification cannot be postponed unless agreed by the operator and in accordance with \na procedure approved by the competent authority. \n2. When deferring or carrying forward a defect rectification, the cumulative effect of a number of \ndeferred or carried forward defects on a given aircraft and any restrictions contained in the MEL \nshould be considered. Whenever possible, deferred defect rectification should be made known \nto the pilot/flight crew prior to their arrival at the aircraft. \n3. In the case of aircraft used by air carriers licensed in accordance with Regulation (EC) \nNo 1008/2008 and of complex motor-powered aircraft, a system of assessment should be in \noperation to support the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft and to provide a continuous \nanalysis of the effectiveness of the CAMO defect control system in use. \nThe system should provide for: ",

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 63 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nGM M.A.301(i) Continuing airworthiness tasks \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nMAINTENANCE CHECK FLIGHTS (MCFs) \n(a) The definition of and operational requirements for MCFs are laid down in the Air Operations \nRegulation \n1 \nand are carried out under the control and responsibility of the aircraft operator. \nDuring the flight preparation, the flight and the post-flight activities as well as for the aircraft \nhandover, the processes requiring the involvement of the maintenance organisations or their \npersonnel should be agreed in advance with the operator. The operator should consult as \nnecessary with the CAMO in charge of the airworthiness of the aircraft. \n(b) Depending on the aircraft defect and the status of the maintenance activity performed before \nthe flight, different scenarios are possible and are described below: \n(1) The aircraft maintenance manual (AMM), or any other maintenance data issued by the \ndesign approval holder or the declarant of a declaration of design compliance, requires \nthat an MCF be performed before completion of the maintenance ordered. In this \nscenario, a certificate after incomplete maintenance, when in compliance with \nM.A.801(f) or 145.A.50(e), should be issued by the maintenance organisation and the \naircraft can be flown for this purpose under its airworthiness certificate. Due to \nincomplete maintenance, for aircraft used in commercial air transport, it is advisable to \nopen a new entry on the aircraft technical log system to identify the need for an MCF. \nThis new entry should contain or refer to, as necessary, data relevant to perform the MCF, \nsuch as aircraft limitations and any potential effect on operational and emergency \nequipment due to incomplete maintenance, maintenance data reference and \nmaintenance actions to be performed after the flight. After a successful MCF, the \nmaintenance records should be completed, the remaining maintenance actions finalised \nand the aircraft released to service in accordance with the maintenance organisation’s \napproved procedures. \n(2) Based on its own experience and for reliability considerations and/or quality assurance, \nan operator or CAMO may wish to perform an MCF after the aircraft has undergone \ncertain maintenance while maintenance data does not call for such a flight. Therefore, \nafter the maintenance has been properly carried out, a certificate of release to service is \nissued and the aircraft airworthiness certificate remains valid for this flight. \n(3) After troubleshooting of a system on the ground, an MCF is proposed by the maintenance \norganisation as confirmation that the solution applied has restored the normal system \noperation. During the maintenance performed, the maintenance instructions are \nfollowed for the complete restoration of the system and therefore a certificate of release \nto service is issued before the flight. The airworthiness certificate is valid for the flight. \nAn open entry requesting this flight may be recorded in the aircraft technical log. \n(4) An aircraft system has been found to fail, the dispatch of the aircraft is not possible in \naccordance with the maintenance data, and the satisfactory diagnosis of the cause of the \nfault can only be made in flight. The process for this troubleshooting is not described in \nthe maintenance data and therefore scenario (1) does not apply. Since the aircraft cannot \nfly under its airworthiness certificate because it has not been released to service after \nmaintenance, a permit to fly issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 is \n1 \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related \nto air operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 296, 25.10.2012, p. 1) \n(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?qid=1568896271265&uri=CELEX:32012R0965).

After the flight and the corresponding maintenance work, the aircraft can be \nreleased to service and continue to operate under its original certificate of airworthiness. \n(c) For certain MCFs the data obtained or verified in flight will be necessary for assessment or \nconsideration after the flight by the maintenance organisation prior to issuing the maintenance \nrelease. For this purpose, when the personnel of the maintenance organisation cannot perform \nthese functions in flight, the maintenance organisation may rely on the crew performing the \nflight to complete this data or to make statements about in-flight verifications. In this case, the \nmaintenance organisation should appoint the crew personnel to play such a role on their behalf \nand, before the flight, brief appointed crew personnel on the scope, functions and the detailed \nprocess to be followed, including required reporting information after the flight and reporting \nmeans, in support of the final release to service to be issued by the certifying staff. \nM.A.302 Aircraft maintenance programme \nRegulation (EU) 2023/989 \n(a) Maintenance of each aircraft shall be organised in accordance with an AMP. \n(b) The AMP and any subsequent amendments thereto shall be approved by the competent \nauthority. \n(c) When the continuing airworthiness of aircraft is managed by a CAMO or CAO, or when there is \na limited contract between the owner and a CAMO or CAO concluded in accordance with point \nM.A.201(i)(3), the AMP and its amendments may be approved through an indirect approval \nprocedure. \nIn that case, the indirect approval procedure shall be established by the CAMO or CAO \nconcerned as part of the continuing airworthiness management exposition (‘CAME’) referred to \nin point CAMO.A.300 of Annex Vc or point M.A.704 of this Annex, or as part of the combined \nairworthiness exposition (‘CAE’) referred to in point CAO.A.025 of Annex Vd and shall be \napproved by the competent authority responsible for that CAMO or CAO. \nThe indirect approval procedure shall only be used when the CAMO or CAO concerned is under \nthe oversight of the Member State of registry of aircraft, unless a written contract has been \nconcluded in accordance with point 3 of point M.1 transferring responsibility for the approval \nof the aircraft maintenance programme to the competent authority responsible for the CAMO \nor CAO. \n(d) The AMP shall demonstrate compliance with: \n(1) the instructions issued by the competent authority; \n(2) the instructions for continuing airworthiness: \n(i) issued by the holders of the type certificate, restricted type certificate, \nsupplemental type certificate, major repair design approval, ETSO authorisation or \nthe declarant of a declaration of design compliance or the holder of any other \nrelevant approval issued under Annex I (Part 21) or, as applicable, Annex Ib (Part \n21 Light), to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012; \n(ii) included in the certification specifications referred to in points 21.A.90B or \n21.A.431B of Annex I (Part 21) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, if applicable; \n(iii) included in the certification specifications referred to in points 21L.A.62, 21L.A.102, \n21L.A.202 or 21L.A.222 of Annex Ib (Part 21 Light) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, \nif applicable; ",

The details of the maintenance programme should be reviewed at least annually. As a minimum, \nrevisions of documents affecting the programme basis need to be considered by the owner or \noperator for inclusion in the maintenance programme during the annual review. Applicable \nmandatory requirements for compliance with Part 21 or Part 21 Light should be incorporated \ninto the aircraft maintenance programme as soon as possible. \n4. The aircraft maintenance programme should contain a preface which will define the \nmaintenance programme contents, the inspection standards to be applied, permitted variations \nto task frequencies and, where applicable, any procedure to manage the evolution of \nestablished check or inspection intervals. \n5. Repetitive maintenance tasks derived from modifications and repairs should be incorporated \ninto the approved maintenance programme. \n6.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 66 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nGM M.A.302(a) Aircraft Maintenance Programme \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nA maintenance programme may indicate that it applies to several aircraft registrations as long as the \nmaintenance programme clearly identifies the effectivity of the tasks and procedures that are not \napplicable to all of the listed registrations. \nAMC M.A.302(d) Aircraft maintenance programme \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nAMP BASIS AND ASSOCIATED PROGRAMMES \n1. An aircraft maintenance programme should normally be based upon the maintenance review \nboard (MRB) report where applicable, the maintenance planning document (MPD), the relevant \nchapters of the maintenance manual or any other maintenance data containing information on \nscheduling. Furthermore, an aircraft maintenance programme should also take into account any \nmaintenance data containing information on scheduling for components. \n2. Instructions issued by the competent authority can encompass all types of instructions from a \nspecific task for a particular aircraft to complete recommended maintenance schedules for \ncertain aircraft types that can be used by the owner/operator directly. These instructions may \nbe issued by the competent authority in the following cases: \n— in the absence of specific recommendations of the Type Certificate Holder or the \ndeclarant of a declaration of design compliance. \n— to provide alternate instructions to those described in the subparagraph 1 above, with \nthe objective of providing flexibility to the operator. \n3. Where an aircraft type has been subjected to the MRB report process, an operator should \nnormally develop the initial aircraft maintenance programme based upon the MRB report. \n4. Where an aircraft is maintained in accordance with an aircraft maintenance programme based \nupon the MRB report process, any associated programme for the continuous surveillance of the \nreliability, or health monitoring of the aircraft should be considered as part of the aircraft \nmaintenance programme. \n5. Aircraft maintenance programmes for aircraft types subjected to the MRB report process should \ncontain identification cross reference to the MRB report tasks such that it is always possible to \nrelate such tasks to the current approved aircraft maintenance programme. This does not \nprevent the approved aircraft maintenance programme from being developed in the light of \nservice experience to beyond the MRB report recommendations but will show the relationship \nto such recommendations. \n6. Some approved aircraft maintenance programmes, not developed from the MRB process, \nutilise reliability programmes. Such reliability programmes should be considered as a part of the \napproved maintenance programme. \n7. Alternate and/or additional instructions to those defined in points M.A.302(d)(1) and (2), \nproposed by the owner or the operator, may include but are not limited to the following: \n— Escalation of the interval for certain tasks based on reliability data or other supporting \ninformation. Appendix I to AMC M.A.302 and AMC M.B.301(b) recommends that the \nmaintenance programme contains the corresponding escalation procedures. The \nescalation of these tasks is directly approved by the competent authority, except in the \ncase of ALIs (Airworthiness Limitations), which are approved by the Agency. ",

Aircraft type training may be sub-divided in airframe and/or powerplant and/or \navionics/electrical systems type training courses. \n− Airframe type training course means a type training course including all relevant aircraft \nstructure and electrical and mechanical systems excluding the powerplant. \n− Powerplant type training course means a type training course on the bare engine, \nincluding the build-up to a quick engine change unit. \n− The interface of the engine/airframe systems should be addressed by either airframe or \npowerplant type training course. In some cases, such as for general aviation, it may be \nmore appropriate to cover the interface during the airframe course due to the large \nvariety of aircraft that can have the same engine type installed. \n− Avionics/electrical systems type training course means type training on avionics and \nelectrical systems covered by but not necessarily limited to ATA (Air Transport \nAssociation) Chapters 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 31, 33, 34, 42, 44, 45, 46, 73 and 77 or equivalent. \n2. Practical training may be performed either following or integrated with the theoretical \nelements. However, it should not be performed before theoretical training. \n3. The content of the theoretical and practical training should: \n− address the different parts of the aircraft which are representative of the structure, the \nsystems/components installed and the cabin; and \n− include training on the use of technical manuals, maintenance procedures and the \ninterface with the operation of the aircraft. \nTherefore it should be based on the following elements: \n− Type design including relevant type design variants, new technology and techniques; \n− Feedback from in-service difficulties, occurrence reporting, etc; \n− Significant applicable airworthiness directives and service bulletins; \n− Known human factor issues associated with the particular aircraft type; \n− Use of common and specific documentation, (when applicable, such as MMEL, AMM, \nMPD, TSM, SRM, WD, AFM, tool handbook), philosophy of the troubleshooting, etc.; \n− Knowledge of the maintenance on-board reporting systems and ETOPS maintenance \nconditions where applicable; \n− Use of special tooling and test equipment and specific maintenance practises including \ncritical safety items and safety precautions; ",

Limited avionic system training should be included in the category B1 type training as the B1 \nprivileges include work on avionics systems requiring simple tests to prove their serviceability. \n5. Electrical systems should be included in both categories of B1 and B2 type training. \n6. The theoretical and practical training should be complementary and may be: \n− integrated or split; \n− supported by the use of training aids, such as trainers, virtual aircraft, aircraft \ncomponents, maintenance simulation training devices (MSTDs) and maintenance training \ndevices (MTDs). \n7. The integration and usage of MSTDs and MTDs, as defined in AMC 147.A.30(a), in maintenance \ntype training (theoretical and/or practical) should consider the following: \n− The use of actual aircraft components should be allowed for any MSTD or MTD, even if \nthe components are in a non-airworthy condition. \n− The complexity and degree of simulation for an MSTD may vary and should support type \ntraining elements that address a component, a system or the entire aircraft. Based on its \ncharacteristics and capabilities, the MSTD may be: \n− a training device capable of providing, for the respective component or system, the \nrepresentation of aircraft location, access and layout, and for servicing with an \nacceptable level of accuracy and limited simulation; or \n− a training device capable of providing, for the respective component or system, the \nrepresentation of aircraft location, access and layout with sufficient accuracy and \nwith interactive simulation for servicing, and the applicable maintenance data for \noperational (O) and functional (F) test elements including built-in test (BIT) \ninitiation and monitoring from outside the cockpit; such representation should \nhave the capability to accommodate some troubleshooting scenarios; or \n− a training device capable of providing, for the respective component or system, the \nrepresentation of onboard (flight deck/cockpit or cabin) indication and controls \nwith an acceptable level of accuracy and limited interactive simulation; or \n− a training device capable of providing, for the respective component or system, the \nrepresentation of onboard (flight deck/cockpit or cabin) indication and controls \nwith sufficient accuracy and with interactive simulation for servicing, and the \napplicable maintenance data for operational (O) and functional (F) test elements ",

The minimum duration for the theoretical element of the type rating training course, as \ndescribed in Appendix III to Part-66, has been determined based on: \n− generic categories of aircraft and minimum standard equipment fit \n− the estimated average duration of standard courses imparted in Europe \n2. The purpose of the Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is to adapt and justify the duration of the \ncourse for a specific aircraft type. This means that the TNA is the main driver for determining \nthe duration of the course, regardless of whether it is above or below the minimum duration \ndescribed in Appendix III to Part-66. \nIn the particular case of type training courses approved on the basis of the requirements valid \nbefore Regulation (EU) No 1149/2011 was applicable (1 August 2012) and having a duration for \nthe theoretical element equal to or above the minimum duration contained in paragraph 3.1(c) \nof Appendix III to Part-66, it is acceptable that the TNA only covers the differences introduced \nby Regulation (EU) No 1149/2011 in paragraph 3.1(e) ‘Content’ and the criteria introduced in \nparagraph 3.1(d) ‘Justification of course duration’ related to the minimum attendance and the \nmaximum number of training hours per day. This TNA may result in a change in the duration of \nthe theoretical element. \n3. The content and the duration deriving from this TNA may be supported by an analysis from the \nType Certificate holder. \n4. In order to approve the reduction of such minimum duration, the competent authority should \nperform an assessment on a case-by-case basis, and the assessment should be appropriate to \nthe aircraft type and to the training methods and tools proposed. \nFor example: \n(a) While it would be exceptional for a theoretical course for a large transport category \naircraft, such as an A330 or a B777, to be below the minimum duration shown, it would \nnot necessarily be exceptional in the case of a business aircraft, such as a Learjet 45 or \nsimilar. The TNA for a business aircraft course could demonstrate that a course of a \nshorter duration satisfies the applicable requirements. \n(b) The use of an MSTD (i.e. flat panel trainer) comprising aircraft-type-specific software may \nresult in the duration of the training being reduced due to a more effective transfer of \nknowledge. \n(c) The use of multimedia-based training (MBT), or blending the training methods, may \nimprove the efficiency of the training and, consequently, contribute to the reduction of \nthe overall time needed to achieve the learning objectives. \n5. When developing the TNA, the following should be considered: \n(a) The TNA should include an analysis identifying all the areas and elements where there is \na need for training as well as the associated learning objectives, considering the design \nphilosophy of the aircraft type, the operational environment, the type of operations and \nthe operational experience. This analysis should be written in a manner which provides a ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 673 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nreasonable understanding of which areas and elements constitute the course in order to \nmeet the learning objectives. \n(b) As a minimum, the Training Need Analysis (TNA) should take into account all the \napplicable elements contained in paragraph 3.1 of Part-66 Appendix III and associated \nAMCs. \n(c) The TNA should set-up the course content considering the Appendix III objectives for each \nlevel of training and the prescribed topics in the theoretical element table contained in \nparagraph 3.1 of Part-66 Appendix III. \n(d) For each chapter described in the theoretical element table contained in paragraph 3.1 \nof Part-66 Appendix III, the corresponding training time should be recorded. \n(e) Typical documents to be used in order to identify the areas and elements where there is \na need for training typically include, among others, the Aircraft Maintenance Manual, \nMRB report, CMRs, airworthiness limitations, Troubleshooting Manual, Structural Repair \nManual, Illustrated Parts Catalogue, Airworthiness Directives and Service Bulletins. \n(f) During the analysis of these documents: \n− Consideration should be given to the following typical activities: \n− Activation/reactivation; \n− Removal/Installation; \n− Testing; \n− Servicing; \n− Inspection, check and repairs; \n− Troubleshooting / diagnosis. \n− For the purpose of identifying the specific elements constituting the training \ncourse, it is acceptable to use a filtering method based on criteria such as: \n− Frequency of the task; \n− Human factor issues associated to the task; \n− Difficulty of the task; \n− Criticality and safety impact of the task; \n− In-service experience; \n− Novel or unusual design features (not covered by Part-66 Appendix I); \n− Similarities with other aircraft types; \n− Special tests and tools/equipment. \n− It is acceptable to follow an approach based on: \n− Tasks or groups of tasks, or \n− Systems or subsystems or components \n(g) The TNA should: \n− Identify the learning objectives for each task, group of tasks, system, subsystem or \ncomponent; ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 674 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− Associate the identified tasks to be trained to the regulatory requirements (table \nin Paragraph 3.1 of Appendix III to Part-66); \n− Organise the training into modules in a logical sequence (adequate combination of \nchapters as defined in Appendix III of Part-66); \n− Determine the sequence of learning (within a lesson and for the whole syllabus); \n− Identify the scope of information and level of detail with regard the minimum \nstandard to which the topics of the TNA should be taught according to the set-up \nobjectives. \n− Address the following: \n− Description of each system/component including the structure (where \napplicable); \n− System/component operation taking into account: \n(a) Complexity of the system (e.g. the need of further break down into \nsubsystems, etc.); \n(b) Design specifics which may require more detailed presentation or may \ncontribute to maintenance errors; \n(c) Normal and emergency functioning; \n(d) Troubleshooting; \n(e) Interpretation of indications and malfunctions; \n(f) Use of maintenance publications; \n(g) Identification of special tools and equipment required for servicing \nand maintaining the aircraft; \n(h) Maintenance Practices; \n(i) Routine inspections, functional or operational tests, \nrigging/adjustment, etc. \n− Describe the following: \n− The instructional methods and training tools and their blended application \nin order to ensure the effectiveness of the training. \n− The maintenance training documentation/material to be delivered to the \nstudent. \n− Facilitated discussions, questioning session, additional practice-oriented \ntraining, etc. \n− The homework, if developed, i.e. to support the achievement of the learning \nobjectives while using asynchronous distance-learning or self-learning \nmethods. \n− The training provider’s resources available to the learner. \n(h) It is acceptable to differentiate between subjects which have to be led by an instructor \nand subjects which may be delivered through interactive simulation training devices \nand/or covered by self-paced elements. The overall time of the course will be allocated \naccordingly. ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 675 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n(i) The maximum number of training hours per day for the theoretical element of type \ntraining should not be more than 6 hours. A training hour means 60 minutes of tuition \nexcluding any breaks, examination, revision, preparation and aircraft visit. In exceptional \ncases, the competent authority may allow deviation from this standard when it is \nproperly justified that the proposed number of hours follows pedagogical and human \nfactors principles. These principles are especially important in those cases where: \n− Theoretical and practical training are performed at the same time; \n− Training and normal maintenance duty/apprenticeship are performed at the same \ntime. \n(j) The minimum participation time in order for the trainee to meet the objectives of the \ncourse should not be less than 90 % of the tuition hours, or 95 % completion of the \ncontent in case of student-centred methods in a theoretical training course. Additional \ntraining may be provided by the training organisation in order to meet the minimum \nparticipation time. If the minimum participation defined for the course is not met, a \ncertificate of recognition should not be issued. \n(k) The TNA is a living process and should be reviewed/updated based on operation \nfeedback, maintenance occurrences, airworthiness directives, major service bulletins \nimpacting maintenance activities or requiring new competencies for mechanics, alert \nservice bulletins, feedback from trainees or customer satisfaction, evolution of the \nmaintenance documentation such as MRBs, MPDs, MMs, etc. The frequency at which the \nTNA should be reviewed/updated is left to the discretion of the organisation conducting \nthe course. \nNOTE: The examination is not part of the TNA.

The organisation at which the final assessment is \ncarried out, should control and coordinate the OJT activities and have the responsibility for the entire \nOJT programme. \nThe procedures for the OJT should be included in the Exposition Manual of the approved maintenance \norganisation. \n‘Skills and responsibilities of a typical certifying staff’ include but are not limited to: \n− understanding the importance of professional integrity, behaviour and having an \nappropriate attitude towards safety; \n− understanding the conditions for ensuring the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and \ncomponents; \n− the ability to identify and rectify existing and potential unsafe conditions; \n− the ability to prioritise tasks, coordinate with a team, and report discrepancies; \n− the ability to determine the required qualifications for the performance of maintenance \ntasks; \n− the ability to confirm the proper accomplishment of maintenance tasks; \n− the ability to compile and control completed work cards; \n− knowledge of safety risks linked to a particular working environment; \n− understanding of human performance and limitations; \n− understanding of the AMO’s (where the OJT is performed) privileges and limitations; \n− understanding of the AMO’s personnel authorisations and limitations; \n− being familiar with the AMO’s documents/forms (work packages, work orders, work \ncards, etc.); \n− being familiar with AMO’s release-to-service procedures: use of the aircraft technical \nlogbook (ATLB), deferral of items and dispatch under MEL/CDL; \n− access, use and control of the required tools and equipment; \n− access, use and control of the required ICAs (AMM, TSM, SRM, etc.). ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 677 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nOJT content and OJT logbook \nIf the aircraft manufacturer has defined the OJT tasks during the type certification of a particular \naircraft type (e.g. the operational suitability data (OSD) has been approved for a particular aircraft \ntype), those tasks should be selected. In particular, the analysis performed for the maintenance areas \nof specific emphasis (MASE), as defined in point 430 of CS-MCSD, helps the organisation identify the \nmore appropriate tasks. \nWhere no such data exists, the task list in Appendix II to the AMC to Annex III (Part-66) serves as the \nbasis to develop an OJT programme including the applicable tasks for a particular aircraft type, based \ntypically on the AMM. The tasks may be selected from the table in Appendix II in order to cover a \nbroader representative sample of both simple and complex tasks on the particular aircraft type in \norder to reach a balanced distribution of the tasks between line and base maintenance. The tasks \nshould be selected among those that are applicable to the aircraft type and the licence (sub)category \napplied for; for example, the selection could exclude location tasks (LOC) and tasks that can be \nconsidered under the category A licence privileges (seat covers, boilers, wheels, etc.). \nA minimum number of tasks, as described in point 2 ‘List of tasks for OJT’ of Appendix II, of each of \nthe following categories should be performed: INS/inspections, FOT/functional or operational, \nSGH/servicing, R/I removal and installation, MEL, and T/S troubleshooting. The licensing authority may \naccept that a limited number of tasks is not performed as long as the relevant cross section of the \ntasks as regards quality, quantity and complexity is still assured. \nA task may be performed on the analogous system installed on a different aircraft type when the \nsystems are similar in terms of design architecture, technology, and functionality. This can be the case, \nfor example, for tasks performed on engines or landing gear of aircraft of the same manufacturer. \nSuch task should be clearly identified and recorded. \nCertain maintenance tasks could be performed on non-airworthy aircraft that still maintain \nfunctionality of systems to the extent that the maintenance tasks can be completely performed \nwithout any deviation from the maintenance instructions. Tasks circumscribed to system components \nmay be performed at the workshop. This can be the case, for example, for avionics functional tests. \nSuch scenarios should be limited to specific tasks that may not occur often in the maintenance of \noperational aircraft. \nThe use of MSTDs and MTDs for OJT should be restricted to a minimum. \nWhen an existing licence is changed to include an additional category with a type rating, a different \nOJT from the category held to the new one may be permissible. In those cases, only tasks \ncorresponding to the differences between the two categories should be performed. \nThe OJT may be partly performed on aircraft whose maintenance is not subject to Regulation (EU) \n2018/1139 (for example, aircraft subject to the FAA regulatory framework or training helicopters used \nby the military) provided that the maintenance is subject to the same procedures and manuals. \nA minimum of maintenance activity on aircraft that are subject to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 is, \nhowever, required in order to gain sufficient insight into the European civil aviation regulatory \nframework and into release-to-service procedures. The acceptance of the OJT is up to the licensing \nauthority. \nThe organisation that has control over the OJT should provide candidates with a schedule or plan \nwhich indicates the list of tasks to be performed under supervision. A record of the completed tasks \nis to be entered into a logbook whose design and format should be such that each task or group of \ntasks is countersigned by the corresponding mentor(s). \nRegarding day-to-day supervision of the OJT programme in the approved maintenance organisation \nand the role of the mentor(s), the following should be considered: ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 678 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− It is sufficient for the completion of the individual OJT tasks to be confirmed by the direct \nmentor(s), without the direct evaluation of the assessor being necessary. \n− During the day-to-day OJT performance, the aim of the supervision is for mentors to oversee \nthe whole process, including task completion, use of manuals, adherence to procedures, \nobservance of safety measures, warnings, cautions and recommendations, and demonstration \nof appropriate behaviour in the maintenance environment. \n− The mentor(s) should personally observe the work being performed to ensure its safe \ncompletion, and should be readily available for consultation if needed during the OJT. \n− The mentor(s) should sign the tasks and release the maintenance tasks as the candidate is still \nnot qualified to do so. \n− The mentor(s) should be designated by the approved maintenance organisation to supervise. \nFor training in release-to-service procedures, following the completion of the performance of a \nspecific task chosen by the mentor, the candidate should prepare a document with simulated release \nto service which has to be marked as ‘for training purposes only’ (e.g. ATL page, maintenance task \ncard, CRS). If both the task and the simulated release to service have been performed to the \nsatisfaction of the mentor, the task may be countersigned in the OJT task list by the mentor. A physical \nor electronic copy of the document with simulated release should be added to the syllabus. \nTasks which are usually performed with more than one person may be performed by more than one \ncandidate under the supervision of one mentor. During the performance of the tasks, the mentor is \nlimited to overseeing three candidates at the same time, given that the candidates can be properly \nseen ‘at a glance’ from the mentor’s position. Those tasks should be marked as ‘group tasks’ when \napplying for the approval. All other tasks should be a one-to-one mentorship. In such cases, all the \ncandidates involved should be noted on the work order. \nAt the end of the performance of the OJT, a compliance report shall be made which verifies and \ndocuments the correct and complete performance and the recommendation of the mentor(s) for the \nfollowing assessment. The mentor(s) may deny a recommendation if the candidate has not \ndemonstrated the knowledge, skills, behaviour and/or ethics required from certifying staff. \nFinal assessment of the applicant \nThe OJT assessment should consist of a theoretical part and a practical part. \nThe theoretical part comprises the regulatory framework, safety procedures, knowledge of aircraft \nand its systems, maintenance procedures, and other typical certifying staff activities such as: \n− the review and acceptance of work orders; \n− shift-handover procedures and team coordination; \n− communication and interaction with the flight crew; \n− dispatch with unserviceable items; \n− clear aircraft logbook entries and reporting notes; \n− checks before release to service. \nThe practical part should include maintenance tasks on the aircraft (e.g. rem./inst., TS, R/I, FOT, MEL \ndispatch). The assessor may decide to simulate some aspects of the maintenance tasks. ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO ANNEX III (Part-66)  Page 679 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nThe aircraft type on which the OJT is performed needs to be available for the assessment together \nwith access to the required maintenance data, equipment, and tools. A training aircraft may be \nacceptable. It is good practice to assess the practical skills on the aircraft in question while the \nassessment of knowledge may be performed either on the aircraft or in theory. \nFurther guidance about the designated assessors is provided in the AMC to Appendix III to Part-66. \nIf an independent observer is required for the OJT, they shall be selected by the maintenance \norganisation among the maintenance personnel that have not taken part in the OJT performance but \ndo have an adequate understanding of the OJT procedures.

The document shall be printed in the standardised form shown but may be reduced in size to \nallow it being generated by computer. When the size is reduced, care shall be taken to ensure \nthat sufficient space is available in those places where official seals or stamps are required. \nComputer-generated documents need not have all the boxes incorporated when any such box \nremains blank, so long as the document can clearly be recognised as an aircraft maintenance \nlicence issued in accordance with Annex III (Part-66). \n3. The document may be filled in either in English or the official language of the Member State of \nthe competent authority. In the latter case, a second copy in English shall be attached to the \ndocument for any licence holder who needs to use the licence outside that Member State to \nensure understanding for the purpose of mutual recognition. \n4. Each licence holder shall have a unique licence holder number, established on the basis of a \nnational identifier and an alpha-numeric designator. \n5. The document may have the pages in a different order to the one of this example and needs \nnot have some or any divider lines as long as the information contained is positioned in such a \nmanner that each page lay-out can clearly be identified with the format of the example of the \naircraft maintenance licence contained herein. \n6. The document shall be prepared by the competent authority. However, it may also be prepared \nby any maintenance organisation approved in accordance with Annex II (Part-145), where the \ncompetent authority agrees to this and the preparation takes place in accordance with a \nprocedure laid down in the maintenance organisation exposition referred to in point 145.A.70 \nof Annex II (Part-145).

An aircraft continuing airworthiness record system includes \nthe processes to keep and manage those records and should be proportionate to the subject \naircraft. Aircraft continuing airworthiness records should provide the owner/CAO/CAMO of an \naircraft with the information needed: \n(1) to demonstrate that the aircraft is in compliance with the applicable airworthiness \nrequirements; and \n(2) to schedule all future maintenance as required by the aircraft maintenance programme \nbased, if any, on the last accomplishment of the specific maintenance as recorded in the \naircraft continuing airworthiness records. \n(b) ‘Applicable airworthiness limitation parameter’ and ‘applicable parameter’ refer to ‘flight \nhours’ and/or ‘flight cycles’ and/or ‘landings’ and/or ‘calendar time’, and/or any other \napplicable utilisation measurement unit, as appropriate. \n(c) A ‘life-limited part’ is a part for which the maintenance schedule of the aircraft maintenance \nprogramme requires the permanent removal from service when, or before, the specified \nmandatory life limitation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 if any of \nthe applicable parameters is reached. \n(d) The ‘current status’ when referring to components of life-limited parts should indicate, for each \naffected part, the life limitation, the total life accumulated in any applicable parameter (as \nappropriate) and the remaining life in any applicable parameter before the life limitation is \nreached. \n(e) The term ‘time-controlled components’ embraces any component for which the maintenance \nschedule of the aircraft maintenance programme requires periodically the removal for \nmaintenance to be performed in an appropriate approved organisation for maintenance in \ncomponents (workshop) to return the component to a specified standard, the replacement of \nsub-components of the assembly by new ones, or the inspection or test of component’s \nperformance, after a service period controlled at component level in accordance with the \nspecified airworthiness limitation defined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) \nNo 748/2012, in any of the applicable parameters. \n(f) The ‘current status’ when referring to time controlled components refers to the current status \nof compliance with the required periodic maintenance task(s) from the maintenance schedule \nof the aircraft maintenance programme specific to the time-controlled components. It should \ninclude the life accumulated by the affected components in the applicable parameter, as \nappropriate, since the last accomplishment of scheduled maintenance specified in the \nmaintenance schedule of the aircraft maintenance programme. Any action that alters the \nperiodicity of the maintenance task(s) or changes the parameter of this periodicity should be \nrecorded. \n(g) ‘Detailed maintenance records’ in this part refers to those records required to be kept by the \nperson or organisation responsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness in accordance with \nM.A.201 in order that they may be able to fulfil their obligations under Part M. \nThese are only a part of the detailed maintenance records required to be kept by a maintenance \norganisation under point M.A.614, CAO.A.090(a) or 145.A.55(a).

Thus, incoming certificates of conformity, batch number references and \nindividual task card sign-offs verified by and/or generated by the maintenance organisation are \nnot required to be retained by the person or organisation responsible in accordance with \nM.A.201. However, dimensional information contained in the task card sign-off or work pack \nmay be requested by the owner/CAO/CAMO in order to verify and demonstrate the \neffectiveness of the aircraft maintenance programme. \nInformation relevant to future maintenance may be contained in specific documents related to: \n− modifications; \n− airworthiness directives; \n− repaired and non-repaired damage; \n− components referred in M.A.305(d); and \n− measurements relating to defects. \n(h) An airworthiness limitation is a boundary beyond which an aircraft or a component thereof \nmust not be operated, unless the instruction(s) associated with this airworthiness limitation is \n(are) complied with. \n(i) ‘Other maintenance required for continuing airworthiness’ refers to unscheduled or out-of- \nphase maintenance due to abnormal or particular conditions or events with an impact on the \ncontinuing airworthiness of the aircraft at the time of its return to service. It is not intended to \nrequest every single condition described in the maintenance data, e.g. Aircraft Maintenance \nManual Chapter 5, but just those that cannot be captured by other means; for example, when \nthey are not included in the records for repairs. Some abnormal or particular conditions or \nevents that could be kept under this requirement could be lightning strikes, hard landings, long- \nterm storage, propeller or rotor over-speed, over-torque, impact on a main rotor blade, etc. \n(j) The term ‘in-service history record’ embraces records from which the current status of life- \nlimited parts can be determined. The ‘in-service history record’ template could be adjusted to \nthe relevant characteristics of the life-limited part, e.g. an engine disk being different from a fire \nextinguisher squib or landing gear sliding tube. \nSuch records document each time a life-limited part is placed in service or removed from \nservice. They should clearly: \n(1) identify the part by its part number and serial number, \n(2) show the date of installation and removal (i.e. date on/date off), \n(3) show the details of the installation and removal (i.e. type, serial number, weight variant, \nthrust rating, as appropriate, of the aircraft, engine, engine module, or propeller) at \ninstallation and removal of the part when this is necessary to appropriately control the \nlife limitation. \n(4) Show the total in-service life accumulated in any applicable parameter, as appropriate, \ncorresponding to the dates of installation and removal of the part.

Not all modifications would necessarily \nbe pertinent to the life limitation of the component. Additionally, if a parameter is not \nrelevant to the life of the part, then that parameter does not need to be recorded. \n(k) The term ‘permanently withdrawn from service’ refers to moving the aircraft or component to \na location that is not used for storage and/or future return to service. \n(l) The term ‘current status’ refers to the data which accurately establishes the level of compliance \nof an aircraft, engine, propeller or component thereof, with a requirement. Each status should: \n(1) identify the aircraft, the engine, the propeller or the component it applies to; \n(2) be dated; and \n(3) include the relevant total in-service life accumulated in the applicable parameter on the \ndate of the status. \nAMC M.A.305(a) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nCERTIFICATE OF RELEASE TO SERVICE \n(a) The inclusion of the certificate of release to service in the aircraft continuing airworthiness \nrecord system means that the date and/or any applicable parameter at which the maintenance \nwas performed, including a unique reference to the certificate of release to service, should be \nprocessed in the record system. \n(b) For components with airworthiness limitations, this information should be found on the \nauthorised release certificate (EASA Form 1 or equivalent). For life-limited parts, some relevant \ninformation required by M.A.305 may need to be introduced in the in-service history records. \nAMC M.A.305(b)1 Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nIN-SERVICE LIFE FOR ENGINES, PROPELLERS AND APU’S \n(a) Some gas turbine engines and propellers are assembled from modules and the total life \naccumulated in service for the complete engine or propeller may not be kept. When owners \nand operators wish to take advantage of the modular design, then the total life accumulated in \nservice for each module, as well as in-service history if applicable, and detailed maintenance \nrecords for each module, should be maintained. The continuing airworthiness records as \nspecified should be kept with the module and should show compliance with any mandatory \nrequirements pertaining to that module. \n(b) The recording of in-service life accumulation may be necessary also in other measurement units \nto ensure the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft. For example, a mandatory life limitation \nmeasured in cycles of auxiliary power unit (APU) usage may apply to some rotating parts. In \nsuch a case, APU cycles need to be recorded. ",

The requirements of Part-66 do not apply to these aircraft. \nNotes on type rating (TR) endorsement covering several models/variants: \nThe endorsement of a type rating (TR) on the aircraft maintenance licence (AML), covering several \nmodels/variants, does not automatically imply that the AML holder has acquired the appropriate \nknowledge on each model/variant. In fact, the AML holder may only have received TR training and/or \ngained experience that was limited to one or several models or variants. \nTo demonstrate adequate competence on the relevant model(s)/variant(s), the AML holder and/or \nthe maintenance organisation where the AML holder is contracted/employed is (are) responsible to \nverify that the model/variant has been adequately covered by the TR course or gained experience and \nis up to date. \nFurther explanation can be found in AMC 66.A.20(b)3 and AMC 145.A.35(a). \nNotes on when and how the licences should be modified: \nThe licensing authorities should implement the new type rating list within 6 months after publication \nof this Decision. During this implementation period, the old type ratings may still be endorsed. New \napplications for type ratings that are no longer certified by EASA should not be accepted. Licences with \nthe old type ratings shall be endorsed with the amended type ratings, whenever the licensing \nauthority deems necessary or the holder requests it; however, no later than the next renewal of the \nlicence. \nThe instructions on how to endorse a modified type rating (for example, in the case of combined or \nsplit TRs) are included in the chapter ‘Details of the changes’ of explanatory note of the decision. \nNotes on aircraft modified by a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC): \n− This Appendix intends to include the type ratings of aircraft resulting from STCs for installation \nof a different engine. These STCs are those approved by EASA and those approved by the \nMember States before 2003 and grandfathered by EASA. STCs other than those for engines are \nnot considered. \nExample: The STC from JET AVIATION AG, approved by the LBA for replacement of GE CF 700 by \nHoneywell TFE731 on Fan Jet Falcon Series E, results in a new rating called ‘Falcon 20E \n(Honeywell TFE731)’. \n− However, the ratings from STCs for installation of an engine: \n− on part of the original airframe models, or ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC TO ANNEX III \n(Part-66)  Page 729 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− from the same manufacturer, but of a type very similar to the original one, have not been \nadded because they would have resulted in an already existing rating. \nExamples: \n− The STC from SILVERHAWK CONVERSIONS approved by EASA for installation of PT6A- \n135A on Beech C90, C90A and E90 would result in the Beech C90/C90A/E90 (PWC PT6) \nrating, but this is not listed because it is already included in the original Beech 90 Series \n(PWC PT6) rating. \n− The STC from Air-Service Wildgruber GmbH approved by LBA for replacement of PWC \nPT6A-20 by PWC PT6A-27 would result in the De Havilland DHC-6-100 (PWC PT6) rating, \nbut this is not listed because it is already included in the De Havilland DHC-6 (PWC PT6) \nrating in the table. \n− EASA has not received all the information concerning STCs that have been previously approved \nby the Member States. As a result, not all STCs are considered by this publication. \n− When the STC concerns the installation of an engine that falls under a different subcategory, \ne.g. replacement of a piston engine by a turboprop (a turbine engine), then the new type rating \nendoresment requires compliance with all the relevant criteria for basic knowledge, experience, \ntype training, and on-the-job training (OJT). \n− In case a type rating resulting from an STC has not been yet defined by EASA, the latter shall be \ncontacted by the competent authority to agree on a new type rating to be used. \nIn the following tables: \n− The table is alphabetically sorted first by TC/STC Holder, then by TR endorsement, and finally \nby Model. \n− The column ‘TC Holder’ includes the TC holder as defined in the type certificate data sheets \n(TCDS) (EASA, FAA or other) or the specific airworthiness specifications (SAS). \n− The column ‘STC Holder’ includes the STC holder as defined in the supplemental type certificate \ndata sheets (STCDS) (EASA, FAA or other). \n− Some TC holders’ designations have been corrected to add the information: ‘Aircraft with an \nSAS’, this means that the aircraft listed under this TC holder designation is considered to be an \n‘orphan aircraft’or General Aviation aircraft form CIS (former Sovjet Union) countries. \n− In Group 3, the column ‘Type of structure’ intends to assist the competent authorities in \nidentifying the experience required for this type with a view to removing existing limitations on \nthe licence. \n− In Group 4, the column ‘Type of structure’ intends to assist the competent authorities in \nidentifying the required ‘L’ subcategories. \n− Wooden structure covered with fabric is considered to fall under wooden structure. For \naeroplanes with a combination of structures, e.g. metal tubing fuselage and wooden wings, \nboth experiences ‘metal tube covered with fabric’ and ‘wooden structure’ are required. \n− In Group 3, the column ‘MTOM’ intends to assist the competent authorities in identifying the \naeroplane types where the maximum take-off mass (MTOM) is: \n− above 2t requires a B1.2 and B2 or B2L licence, or \n− 2t and below requires a B1.2 or B3 and B2 or B2L licence.

For \nthe purpose of assessing the AD status, there is no need to list those ADs which are superseded \nor cancelled. \n(b) If the AD is generally applicable to the aircraft or component type but is not applicable to the \nparticular aircraft, engine, propeller or component, then this should be identified with the \nreason why it is not applicable. \n(c) The current status of ADs should include the release to service date on which the AD or measure \nwas accomplished (the date the certificate of release to service was issued), and where the AD \nor measure is controlled by flight hours and/or flight cycles and/or landings and/or any other \napplicable parameter, as appropriate, it should include the corresponding total life on that \nparameter accumulated in service on the date when the AD or measure was accomplished \nand/or the due limit in the appropriate parameter. For repetitive ADs or measures, only the last \nand next applications with the reference to the applicable parameter should be recorded in the \ncurrent status. \n(d) The status should also specify the method of compliance and which part of a multi-part AD or \nmeasure has been accomplished, where a choice is available in the AD or measure. \n(e) The current status of AD should be sufficiently detailed to identify any loadable software aircraft \npart which is used for operating or controlling the aircraft. \n(f) When the AD is multi-part or requests assessments of certain inspections, this information \nshould be shown as well. \nAMC M.A.305(c)2 Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nMODIFICATIONS AND REPAIRS \n(a) Status of current modifications and repairs means a list compiled at aircraft level of \nmodifications and repairs currently embodied. It should include the identification of the aircraft, \nengine(s) or propeller(s), as appropriate, and the date of the certificate of release to service \nwhen the modification or repair was accomplished. Where a modification or repair creates the \nneed for the accomplishment of scheduled maintenance tasks, the reference to the applicable \ntasks should be added to the aircraft maintenance programme. The status should include the \nreference to the data in accordance with M.A.304 that provides the accomplishment procedure \nfor the modification or repair. It should also specify which part of a multi-part modification or \nrepair has been accomplished and the method of compliance, where a choice is available in the \ndata. \n(b) In addition to the previous applicable information, in respect to structure, the status of the \ncurrent repairs should contain the description of the repair (e.g. doubler, blend, crack, dent, \netc.), its location (e.g. reference to stringers, frames, etc.) and the dimensions. In the case of \nblend-out repairs, the remaining material should be recorded too. \n(c) The status of modifications should be sufficiently detailed to identify any installed loadable \nsoftware aircraft part used for operating or controlling the aircraft, the part number of which ",

OSD data is owned by the TCH \n(see TCHs contact list: https://www.easa.europa.eu/document-library/operational- \nsuitability-data/osd-contact-list). \nType training courses approved before the approval of the OSD-MCS shall include the \nOSD elements within 2 years after the OSD-MCS approval. \n− STC reference number. \n− ‘TC (or STC) not yet released’ means that the type certificate (or STC) has not yet been \nreleased by EASA at the date of publication of this ED Decision, but the final model \nconfiguration is sufficiently mature that the type rating endorsement can be already \ndefined. In this case, the initial training and licensing may start and be used for approval \nof type training courses and Part-66 licence endorsement. On the contrary, the associated \nrating for the maintenance organisation can be granted only after the type certification \nof the aircraft (or after the approval of the STC). \nGROUP 1 AEROPLANES \nED Decision 2023/019/R \nGROUP 1 AEROPLANES \nTC Holder Model Com. des.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 76 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nGM M.A.305(d)(2) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2023/013/R \nTASKS CONTROLLED AT COMPONENT LEVEL \n(a) The maintenance schedule of the aircraft maintenance programme may include tasks \ncontrolled at component level coming from a mandatory requirement in accordance with \nPart 21 or Part 21 Light and to be performed in a workshop, such as: \n(1) the removal of a component for periodic restoration to return the component to a \nspecified standard (e.g. removal of the landing gear for overhaul); \n(2) the periodic removal of a component for replacement of a sub-component by a new one \nwhen it is not possible to restore the item to a specific standard of failure resistance (e.g. \ndiscarding of universal joints of a gearbox, batteries of the escape slide/raft, discharge \ncartridges of fire extinguishers, etc.); and \n(3) a periodic inspection or test to confirm that a component meets specified performance \nstandards (e.g. functional check of the portable emergency locator transmitter, etc.). The \ncomponent is left in service (no further maintenance action taken) on the condition that \nit continues to fulfil its intended purpose within specified performance limits until the \nnext scheduled inspection. \nThe above tasks apply to ‘time-controlled components’ as defined in paragraph (e) of \nGM M.A.305. If a component affected by a task in accordance with (2) and (3) above is \ncontrolled at aircraft level by the aircraft maintenance programme and it has not been removed \nsince the task was last accomplished, then its status of compliance with M.A.305(d)2 is already \ndemonstrated by the aircraft records. \nNote: The maintenance in accordance: \n− with (1) and (2) above assumes a predictable deterioration of the component: the overall \nreliability invariably decreases with age; and \n− with (3) assumes a gradual deterioration of the component: failure resistance can reduce \nand drop below a defined level. \n(b) When a component is affected by a maintenance task contained in the aircraft maintenance \nprogramme (AMP) that is recommended by the design approval holder (DAH) or the declarant \nof a declaration of design compliance and controlled at component level, although such \ncomponent does not qualify as a time-controlled component, the status of the component may \nbe needed to show that all the maintenance due on the aircraft according to the aircraft \nmaintenance programme has been carried out. There is no specific requirement to keep the \nEASA Form 1 or equivalent or any other detailed maintenance records. \n(c) For aircraft maintenance programmes developed under a primary maintenance process- \noriented methodology (e.g. Maintenance Steering Group), the term ‘time-controlled \ncomponent’ pertains to ‘Hard Time’ and ‘On-Condition’. The primary maintenance processes \nare: \n(1) Hard Time \nThis is a preventive process in which known deterioration of a component is limited to an \nacceptable level by the maintenance actions which are carried out at periods related to \ntime in service (e.g. calendar time, number of cycles, number of landings). The prescribed \nactions restore the component utility margin to the applicable time limitation. ",

The purpose is to remove the component before its failure in service. \n(3) Condition Monitoring \nThis is a process in which a parameter of a condition in a component (vibration, \ntemperature, oil consumption, etc.) is monitored to identify the development of a fault. \nThe purpose is to remove the component before its failure in service (e.g. due to related \nrepair costs), but they are permitted to remain in service without preventive \nmaintenance until a functional failure occurs. \nNote: For components that are not subject to any of these primary maintenance processes, \ncorrective maintenance is carried out after failure detection and is aimed at restoring \ncomponents to a condition in which they can perform their intended function (‘fly-to failure’). \n(d) The following table provides a summary of the records’ requirements related to components \nsubjected to primary maintenance process, including components without an EASA Form 1 in \naccordance with point 21.A.307 (c) of Part 21 or point 21L.A.193(c) of Part 21 Light: \nPrimary \nmaintenance \nprocess \nContinuing airworthiness records \nLife-limited \npart \n− Current status (M.A.305(d)(1)); \n− In-service history record (M.A.305(e)(3)(i)); \n− EASA Form 1 and detailed maintenance records for last \nscheduled maintenance and subsequent unscheduled \nmaintenance (M.A.305(e)(3)(ii)), including modifications and \nrepairs (M.A.305(e)(2)(ii)). \nTime- \ncontrolled \ncomponent \nHard time − Current status (M.A.305(d)(2)); \n− EASA Form 1 and detailed maintenance records for last \nscheduled maintenance and subsequent unscheduled \nmaintenance (M.A.305(e)(3)(ii)), including modifications and \nrepairs (M.A.305(e)(2)(ii)). \nOn condition − Current status (M.A.305(d)(2)); and \n− EASA Form 1 and detailed maintenance records for last \nscheduled maintenance and subsequent unscheduled \nmaintenance (M.A.305(e)(3)(ii)) \nIf the task is controlled at aircraft level, the above information could \nbe already contained in the records related to the aircraft \nmaintenance programme (M.A.305(c)(3) and M.A.305(e)(2)(iii)). If \nthe maintenance was performed off wing, the EASA Form 1 needs to \nbe kept. \nCondition monitoring The EASA Form 1 does not need to be kept unless this is the means \nto fulfil another requirement; for example, an AD compliance. \nELA 2 aircraft : any \ncomponent that is fitted \nwithout an EASA Form 1 in \naccordance with 21.A.307 (c) \nor 21L.A.193(c) \nThe certificate of release to service and owner’s acceptance \nstatement (M.A.305(e)(3)(iii)).

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 79 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nAll physical records should remain legible throughout the required retention period. Physical \nrecords on either paper or microfilm systems should use robust material, which can withstand \nnormal handling, filing and ageing. They should be stored in a safe way with regard to damage, \nalteration and theft. \n(e) Digitised records \nDigitised records may be created from a paper document (original or copy) or from electronic \ndata. \nWhen created from a paper document: \n(1) the creation date of the digitised record should be stored with the digitised record; \n(2) it is advisable to create an individual digitised record for each document; \n(3) if an organisation creates a large number of digitised records, the use of database \ntechnology should ease the future retrieval of the record; and \n(4) digitised records should be legible, including details such as, but not limited to, the date \nof signature, names, stamps, notes, or drawings. \n(f) Digitised record retention \nDigitised records when created from an original paper record, or as a digital electronic original, \nshould be stored on a system which is secured and kept in an environment protected from \ndamage (e.g. fire, flooding, excessive temperature or accidental erasing). IT systems should \nhave at least one backup system, which should be updated at least within 24 hours of any entry \nin the primary system. Access to both primary and backup systems is required to be protected \nagainst the ability of unauthorised personnel to alter the database and they should preferably \nbe located remotely from the main system. \nThe system used for retention of digitised records should: \n(1) ensure the integrity, accuracy and completeness of the record; \n(2) ensure that access to the digitised record has safeguards against alteration of the data; \n(3) ensure the authenticity of the record including assurance that the date has not been \nmodified after creation; \n(4) be capable of retrieving individual records within a reasonable time period; and \n(5) be maintained against technological obsolescence which would prevent printing, \ndisplaying or retrieval of the digitised records. \nComputer backup discs, tapes etc. should be stored in a different location from that containing \nthe current working discs, tapes, etc. and in a safe environment. \nWhere the competent authority has accepted a system for digitised record-keeping satisfying \nthe above, the paper document may be permanently disposed of. \n(g) Lost or destroyed records \nReconstruction of lost or destroyed records can be done by reference to other records which \nreflect the time in service, research of records maintained by maintenance organisations and \nreference to records maintained by individual mechanics, etc. When reconstruction has been \ndone and the record is still incomplete, the owner/operator may make a statement in the new \nrecord describing the loss and establishing the time in service based on the research and the \nbest estimate of time in service. The reconstructed records should be submitted to the ",

The competent authority may require the performance of \nadditional maintenance if not satisfied with the reconstructed records. \nAMC M.A.305(e)(1) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nThis retention period of 36 months could be extended in the case of an entry in the technical log \nsystem requiring an additional period of retention as defined in Part-M. \nAMC M.A.305(e)(2) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) EASA Form 1 and the Certificate of Conformity of the components used to perform a \nmodification/repair are not part of the substantiation data for a modification/repair. These \ncertificates are retained by the maintenance organisation. \n(b) In the case of an AD with several steps or with intermediate assessments during its application, \nthese intermediate steps should be part of the detailed maintenance records. \nGM M.A.305(e)(2) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n‘Until such time as the information contained therein is superseded by new information equivalent in \nscope and detail but not shorter than 36 months’ means that during a maximum of 36 months the \ninformation and the one superseding it will be kept but, after these 36 months, only the new \ninformation must be kept. \nFor example, for a maintenance task with an interval shorter than 36 months, more than one set of \ninformation equivalent in scope and detail should be retained. If the maintenance task interval is \nlonger than 36 months, the last set of information equivalent in scope and detail is retained. \nAMC M.A.305(e)(3) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2023/013/R \n(a) An EASA Form 1 and detailed maintenance records are not required to be kept to support every \ninstallation/removal shown in the in-service history records. \n(b) Conservative methods to manage missing historical periods are acceptable to establish the \ncurrent status of the life-limited part. In the case of use of a conservative method, the \nsupporting documents should be endorsed. Recommendations from the design approval holder \nor the declarant of a declaration of design compliance on the procedures to record or \nreconstruct the in-service history should be considered. \nGM M.A.305(e)(3) Aircraft continuing airworthiness record system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \n(a) EASA Form 1 or equivalent is not required to be kept for the ‘condition monitoring’ process of \ncomponents unless this is the means to fulfil another requirement quoted in M.A.305 (e.g. \ndemonstration of AD compliance). \n(b) For components that are not subject to any of the primary maintenance processes described in \nthe GM M.A.305(d)(2) (i.e. Hard Time, On-Condition, Condition Monitoring), the EASA Form 1 \nor equivalent is not required to be kept.

If they cease to be the owner or organisation \nresponsible for the aircraft continuing airworthiness of the aircraft, they also remain responsible for \ntransferring the records to the new owner or organisation. \nM.A.306 Aircraft technical log system \nRegulation (EU) 2020/270 \n(a) In addition to the requirements of point M.A.305, for CAT, commercial specialised operations \nand commercial ATO or commercial DTO operations, the operator shall use a technical log \nsystem containing the following information for each aircraft: \n1. information about each flight, necessary to ensure continued flight safety, and; \n2. the current aircraft certificate of release to service, and; \n3. the current maintenance statement giving the aircraft maintenance status of what \nscheduled and out of phase maintenance is next due except that the competent authority \nmay agree to the maintenance statement being kept elsewhere, and; \n4. all outstanding deferred defects rectifications that affect the operation of the aircraft, \nand; \n5. any necessary guidance instructions on maintenance support arrangements. \n(b) The initial issue of aircraft technical log system shall be approved by the competent authority \nspecified in point CAMO.A.105 of Annex Vc (Part-CAMO), or point M.1 of this Annex (Part-M) or \npoint CAO.1(1) of Annex Vd (Part-CAO), as applicable. Any subsequent amendment to that \nsystem shall be managed in accordance with point CAMO.A.300(c), or points M.A.704(b) and \n(c), or point CAO.A.025(c). \nAMC M.A.306(a) Aircraft technical log system \nED Decision 2020/002/R \nCONTENT OF INFORMATION ON THE ATL SYSTEM \nFor CAT operations, commercial specialised operations and commercial ATO or commercial DTO \noperations, the aircraft technical log is a system for recording defects and malfunctions during the \naircraft operation and for recording details of all maintenance carried out on an aircraft between \nscheduled base maintenance visits. In addition, it is used for recording flight safety and maintenance \ninformation the operating crew need to know. \nCabin or galley defects and malfunctions that affect the safe operation of the aircraft or the safety of \nits occupants are regarded as forming part of the aircraft log book where recorded by another means. \nThe aircraft technical log system may range from a simple single section document to a complex \nsystem containing many sections but in all cases it should include the information specified for the \nexample used here which happens to use a 5 section document / computer system: \nSection 1 should contain details of the registered name and address of the operator the aircraft type \nand the complete international registration marks of the aircraft.

    " \nAnnex I (Part-M) \nSECTION A — TECHNICAL \nREQUIREMENTS  Page 82 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nSection 2 should contain details of when the next scheduled maintenance is due, including, if relevant \nany out of phase component changes due before the next maintenance check. In addition this section \nshould contain the current certificate of release to service (CRS), for the complete aircraft, issued \nnormally at the end of the last maintenance check. \nNOTE: The flight crew do not need to receive such details if the next scheduled maintenance is \ncontrolled by other means acceptable to the competent authority. \nSection 3 should contain details of all information considered necessary to ensure continued flight \nsafety. Such information includes: \n(i) the aircraft type and registration mark, \n(ii) the date and place of take-off and landing, \n(iii) the times at which the aircraft took off and landed, \n(iv) the running total of flying hours, such that the hours to the next schedule maintenance can be \ndetermined. The flight crew does not need to receive such details if the next scheduled \nmaintenance is controlled by other means acceptable to the competent authority. \n(v) details of any failure, defect or malfunction to the aircraft affecting airworthiness or safe \noperation of the aircraft including emergency systems, and any failure, defect or malfunctions \nin the cabin or galleys that affect the safe operation of the aircraft or the safety of its occupants \nthat are known to the commander. Provision should be made for the commander to date and \nsign such entries including, where appropriate, the nil defect state for continuity of the record. \nProvision should be made for a CRS following rectification of a defect or any deferred defect or \nmaintenance check carried out. Such a certificate appearing on each page of this section should \nreadily identify the defect(s) to which it relates or the particular maintenance check as \nappropriate. \nIn the case of maintenance performed by a Part-145 maintenance organisation, it is acceptable \nto use an alternate abbreviated certificate of release to service consisting of the statement \n‘Part-145 release to service’ instead of the full certification statement specified in \nAMC 145.A.50(b) paragraph 1. When the alternate abbreviated certificate of release to service \nis used, the introductory section of the technical log should include an example of the full \ncertification statement from AMC 145.A.50(b) paragraph 1. \n(vi) the quantity of fuel and oil uplifted and the quantity of fuel available in each tank, or \ncombination of tanks, at the beginning and end of each flight; provision to show, in the same \nunits of quantity, both the amount of fuel planned to be uplifted and the amount of fuel actually \nuplifted; provision for the time when ground de-icing and/or anti-icing was started and the type \nof fluid applied, including mixture ratio fluid/water and any other information required by the \noperator's procedures in order to allow the assessment on whether inspections for and/or \nelimination of de-icing/anti-icing fluid residues that could endanger flight safety are required. \n(vii) the pre-flight inspection signature. \nIn addition to the above, it may be necessary to record the following supplementary \ninformation: \n− the time spent in particular engine power ranges where use of such engine power affects \nthe life of the engine or engine module; \n− the number of landings where landings affect the life of an aircraft or aircraft component; \n− flight cycles or flight pressure cycles where such cycles affect the life of an aircraft or \naircraft component.

Data being made available to personnel maintaining aircraft means that the data should be \navailable in close proximity to the aircraft or component being maintained, for mechanics and \ncertifying staff to perform maintenance. \n2. Where computer systems are used, the number of computer terminals should be sufficient in \nrelation to the size of the work programme to enable easy access, unless the computer system \ncan produce paper copies. Where microfilm or microfiche readers/printers are used, a similar \nrequirement is applicable. \n3. Maintenance tasks should be transcribed onto the work cards or worksheets and subdivided \ninto clear stages to ensure a record of the accomplishment of the maintenance task. Of \nparticular importance is the need to differentiate and specify, when relevant, disassembly, \naccomplishment of task, reassembly and testing. In the case of a lengthy maintenance task \ninvolving a succession of personnel to complete such task, it may be necessary to use \nsupplementary work cards or worksheets to indicate what was actually accomplished by each \nindividual person. A worksheet or work card system should refer to particular maintenance \ntasks. \n4. The workcard/worksheet system may take the form of, but is not limited to, the following: \n− a format where the mechanic writes the defect and the maintenance action taken \ntogether with information of the maintenance data used, including its revision status, \n− an aircraft log book that contains the reports of defects and the actions taken by \nauthorised personnel together with information of the maintenance data used, including \nits revision status, \n− for maintenance checks, the checklist issued by the manufacturer (i.e., 100H checklist, \nRevision 5, Items 1 through 95) \n5. Maintenance data should be kept up to date by: \n− subscribing to the applicable amendment scheme, \n− checking that all amendments are being received, \n− monitoring the amendment status of all data. \nM.A.402 Performance of maintenance \nRegulation (EU) 2015/1536 \nExcept for maintenance performed by a maintenance organisation approved in accordance with \nAnnex II (Part-145), any person or organisation performing maintenance shall: \n(a) be qualified for the tasks performed, as required by this part; \n(b) ensure that the area in which maintenance is carried out is well organised and clean in respect \nof dirt and contamination; \n(c) use the methods, techniques, standards and instructions specified in the M.A.401 maintenance \ndata; \n(d) use the tools, equipment and material specified in the M.A.401 maintenance data. If necessary, \ntools and equipment shall be controlled and calibrated to an officially recognised standard; ",

Inspection, service or calibration that is performed on a regular basis should be \nperformed in accordance with the equipment manufacturers’ instructions. All tools requiring \ncalibration should be traceable to an acceptable standard. \nIn this context, ‘officially recognised standards’ means those standards established or published by an \nofficial body, being either a natural or legal person, and which are widely recognised by the air \ntransport sector as constituting good practice. \nIf the organisation responsible for the type design involved recommends special equipment or test \napparatuses, personnel should use the recommended equipment or apparatuses or equivalent \nequipment accepted by the competent authority. \nAll work should be performed using materials of such quality and in such a manner that the condition \nof the aircraft or its components after maintenance is at least equal to its or their original or modified \ncondition (with regard to aerodynamic function, structural strength, resistance to vibration, \ndeterioration and any other qualities affecting airworthiness). \nAMC M.A.402(e) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nThe working environment should be appropriate for the maintenance task being performed such that \nthe effectiveness of personnel is not impaired. \n(a) Temperature should be maintained such that personnel can perform the required tasks without \nundue discomfort. \n(b) Airborne contamination (e.g. dust, precipitation, paint particles, filings) should be kept to a \nminimum to ensure aircraft/components surfaces are not contaminated, if this is not possible \nall susceptible systems should be sealed until acceptable conditions are re-established. \n(c) Lighting should be adequate to ensure each inspection and maintenance task can be performed \neffectively. \n(d) Noise levels should not be allowed to rise to the level of distraction for inspection staff or if this \nis not possible inspection staff should be provided with personnel equipment to reduce \nexcessive noise. \nAMC M.A.402(f) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nFacilities should be provided appropriate for all planned maintenance. This may require aircraft \nhangars that are both available and large enough for the planned maintenance. \nAircraft component workshops should be large enough to accommodate the components that are \nplanned to be maintained. \nProtection from inclement weather means the hangar or component workshop structures should be \nto a standard that prevents the ingress of rain, hail, ice, snow, wind and dust etc. ",

However, when only one person is available, then this person should perform \nreinspection of the tasks as described in AMC2 M.A.402(h). \nAMC1 M.A.402(h) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nCRITICAL MAINTENANCE TASKS \nThe following maintenance tasks should primarily be reviewed to assess their impact on safety: \n(a) tasks that may affect the control of the aircraft, flight path and attitude, such as installation, \nrigging and adjustments of flight controls; \n(b) aircraft stability control systems (autopilot, fuel transfer); \n(c) tasks that may affect the propulsive force of the aircraft, including installation of aircraft \nengines, propellers and rotors; and \n(d) overhaul, calibration or rigging of engines, propellers, transmissions and gearboxes. \nAMC2 M.A.402(h) Performance of maintenance \nED Decision 2016/011/R \nINDEPENDENT INSPECTION \n(a) What is an independent inspection \nIndependent inspection is one possible error-capturing method. It consists of an inspection \nperformed by an ‘independent qualified person’ of a task carried out by an ‘authorised person’, \ntaking into account that: \n(1) the ‘authorised person’ is the person who performs the task or supervises the task and \nassumes the full responsibility for the completion of the task in accordance with the \napplicable maintenance data; \n(2) the ‘independent qualified person’ is the person who performs the independent \ninspection and attests the satisfactory completion of the task and that no deficiencies \nhave been found. The ‘independent qualified person’ does not issue a certificate of \nrelease to service, therefore he/she is not required to hold certification privileges; ",

This \ntraining and experience could be demonstrated, for example, by: \n(i) holding a Part-66 licence in the same subcategory as the licence subcategory or \nequivalent necessary to release or sign off the critical maintenance task; \n(ii) holding a Part-66 licence in the same category and specific training in the task to \nbe inspected; or \n(iii) having received appropriate training and having gained relevant experience in the \nspecific task to be inspected. \n(2) When the work is performed outside a Part-M Subpart F organisation: \n(i) the ‘independent qualified person’ should hold: \n(A) a Part-66 licence in any category or an equivalent national qualification \nwhen national regulations apply; or \n(B) a valid pilot licence for the aircraft type issued in accordance with European \nUnion regulations or an equivalent national qualification when national \nregulations apply; \n(ii) additionally, the ‘authorised person’ should assess the qualifications and \nexperience of the ‘independent qualified person’ taking into account that the \n‘independent qualified person’ should have received training and have experience \nin the particular task. It should not be acceptable that the ‘authorised person’ \nshows to the ‘independent qualified person’ how to perform the inspection once \nwork has been already finalised. \n(c) How should independent inspection be performed \nIndependent inspection should ensure for example correct assembly, locking and sense of \noperation. When inspecting control systems that have undergone maintenance, the \n‘independent qualified person’ should consider the following points independently: \n(1) all those parts of the system that have actually been disconnected or disturbed should be \ninspected for correct assembly and locking; \n(2) the system as a whole should be inspected for full and free movement over the complete \nrange; \n(3) cables should be tensioned correctly with adequate clearance at secondary stops; \n(4) the operation of the control system as a whole should be observed to ensure that the \ncontrols are operating in the correct sense; \n(5) if different control systems are interconnected so that they affect each other, all the \ninteractions should be checked through the full range of the applicable controls; and ",

The purpose of this document is not to \ndescribe the examination process: this material mainly addresses the evaluation of ‘skills’ and \n‘attitude’ after training containing practical elements. Nevertheless, the trainee needs to \ndemonstrate to have sufficient knowledge to perform the required tasks. \n‘Attitude’ is indivisible from the ‘skill’ as this greatly contributes to the safe performance of the \ntasks. \nThe evaluation of the competence should be based on the learning objectives of the training, in \nparticular: \n− the (observable) desired performance. This covers what the trainee is expected to be able \nto do and how the trainee is expected to behave at the end of the training; \n− the (measurable) performance standard that must be attained to confirm the trainee’s \nlevel of competence in the form of tolerances, constraints, limits, performance rates or \nqualitative statements; and \n− the conditions under which the trainee will demonstrate competence. Conditions consist \nof the training methods, the environmental, situational and regulatory factors. \nThe assessment should focus on the competencies relevant to the aircraft type and its \nmaintenance such as, but not limited to: \n− Environment awareness (act safely, apply safety precautions and prevent dangerous \nsituations); \n− Systems integration (demonstrate understanding of aircraft systems interaction – \nidentify, describe, explain, plan, execute); \n− Knowledge and understanding of areas requiring special emphasis or novelty (areas \npeculiar to the aircraft type, domains not covered by Part-66 Appendix I, practical training \nelements that cannot be imparted through simulation devices, etc.); \n− Using reports and indications (the ability to read and interpret); \n− Aircraft documentation finding and handling (identify the appropriate aircraft \ndocumentation, navigate, execute and obey the prescribed maintenance procedures); \n− Perform maintenance actions (demonstrate safe handling of aircraft, engines, \ncomponents and tools); ",
    " \nAnnex III (Part-66) \nAPPENDICES TO AMC TO ANNEX III \n(Part-66)  Page 926 of 1265| Jul 2024 \n− Aircraft final/close-up and report (apply close up, initiate appropriate actions/follow- \nup/records of testing, establish and sign maintenance records/logbooks). \n2) How to assess \nAs far as feasible, the objectives of the assessment should be associated with the learning \nobjectives and the passing level; it means that observable criteria should be set in order to \nmeasure the performance and should remain as objective as possible. \nThe general characteristics of effective assessment are: objective, flexible, acceptable, \ncomprehensive, constructive, organised and thoughtful. At the conclusion, the trainee should \nhave no doubt about what he/she did well, what he/she did poorly and how he/she can \nimprove. \nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of questions that may be posed to assist assessment: \n− What are the success factors for the job? \n− What are typical characteristics of a correct behaviour for the task? \n− What criteria should be observed? \n− What level of expertise is expected? \n− Is there any standard available? \n− What is the pass mark? For example: \n− ‘Go-no go’ situation; \n− How to allocate points? Minimum amount to succeed; \n− ‘Must know or execute’ versus ‘Good to know or execute’ versus ‘Don’t expect the \ncandidate to be an expert’. \n− Minimum or maximum time to achieve? Use time effectively and efficiently. \n− What if the trainee fails? How many times is the trainee allowed to fail? \n− When and how should the trainee be prepared for the assessment? \n− What proportion of judgment by the instructor out of collaboration with the trainee is \nneeded during the evaluation stage? \nThe assessment may be: \n− diagnostic (prior to a course), formative (re-orientate the course on areas where there is \na need to reinforce) or summative (partial or final evaluation); \n− performed task-by-task, as a group of tasks or as a final assessment; \nOne method might be an initial assessment to be performed by the trainee himself, then \ndiscussing areas where the perceptions of the trainee’s performance by the assessors differ in \norder to: \n− develop the self-assessment habits; \n− make the assessment more acceptable and understandable to both parties. \nA ‘box-ticking’ exercise would be pointless. Experience has shown that assessment sheets have \nlargely evolved over time into assessment of groups of ‘skills’ because in practice such things \neventually detracted from the training and assessment that it was intended to serve: evaluate ",

Whenever possible (depending on the size of the organisation), it is recommended \nto split the roles (two different persons) in order to avoid any conflicts of interests. \nWhen the functions are not combined, the role of each function should be clearly understood.

Commonly the training \ntools are a blackboard and training manuals. New technologies make it possible to develop new \ntraining methods and use other training tools, e.g. multimedia-based training and virtual reality. A \ncombination of several training methods/tools is recommended in order to increase the overall \neffectiveness of the training. \nSimulation cannot be eligible as a sole training or assessment tool for basic hand skills such as wiring, \nwelding, drilling, filing, wire locking, riveting, bonding or any other skill where competence may only \nbe achievable by performing a hands-on activity. \nThree tables are provided to illustrate the possibilities for the use of different training methods and \ntools: \nTable 1: Training tools \nTable 2: Training methods \nTable 3: Combination of training methods and tools and their use \nTable 1 lists existing training tools that may be selected for the training. \nTable 1: Training tools \nTraining tools Description \n1 Slideshow presentation A structured presentation of slides. \n2 Manuals Comprehensive and controlled publication of a particular topic. \n3 Computer (desktop PC, \nlaptop, etc.) \nAn electronic processing device that can hold and display information in \nvarious media. \n4 Mobile devices (such as, \nbut not limited to, tablets, \nsmart phones, etc.) \nA mobile electronic processing device that can hold and display \ninformation in various media. \n5 Videos Electronic media for broadcasting moving visual images. \n6 MSTD — Maintenance \nsimulation training device \nA training device that is intended to be used in maintenance training, \nexamination, and/or assessment for a component, system or entire \naircraft.

The independent audit procedure should ensure that all aspects of Part-147 compliance should \nbe checked at least once in every 12 months and may be carried out as one complete single \nexercise or subdivided over a 12-month period in accordance with a scheduled plan. \n2. In a small maintenance training organisation the independent audit function may be contracted \nto another maintenance training organisation approved under Part-147 or a competent person \nacceptable to the competent authority. Where the small training organisation chooses to \ncontract the audit function it is conditional on the audit being carried out twice in every 12 \nmonth period with one such audit being unannounced. \n3. Where the maintenance training organisation is also approved to another Part requiring a \nquality system, then such quality systems may be combined. \n4. When training or examination is carried out under the sub-contract control system: \n(i) a pre audit procedure should be established whereby the Part-147 approved \nmaintenance training organisation’ should audit a prospective sub-contractor to \ndetermine whether the services of the sub-contractor meet the intent of Part-147. \n(ii) a renewal audit of the subcontractor should be performed at least once every 12 months \nto ensure continuous compliance with the Part-147 standard. \n(iii) the sub-contract control procedure should record audits of the sub-contractor and to \nhave a corrective action follow-up plan. \n5. The independence of the audit system should be established by always ensuring that audits are \ncarried out by personnel not responsible for the function or procedure being checked. \nGM to 147.A.130(b) Training procedures and quality system \nED Decision 2015/029/R \n1. The primary objective of the quality system is to enable the training organisation to satisfy itself \nthat it can deliver properly trained students and that the organisation remains in compliance \nwith Part-147. \n2. The independent audit is a process of routine sample checks of all aspects of the training \norganisation’s ability to carry out all training and examinations to the required standards. It \nrepresents an overview of the complete training system and does not replace the need for \ninstructors to ensure that they carry out training to the required standard. \n3. A report should be raised each time an audit is carried out describing what was checked and \nany resulting findings. The report should be sent to the affected department(s) for rectification \naction giving target rectification dates. Possible rectification dates may be discussed with the \naffected department(s) before the quality department confirms such dates on the report. The \naffected department(s) should rectify any findings and inform the quality department of such \nrectification. \n4. A large training organisation (an organisation with the capacity to provide training for 50 \nstudents or more) should have a dedicated quality audit group whose sole function is to conduct \naudits, raise finding reports and follow up to ensure that findings are being rectified. For the \nsmall training organisation (an organisation with the capacity to provide training for less than \n50 students) it is acceptable to use competent personnel from one section/department not \nresponsible for the function or procedure to check the section/department that is responsible ",

The management control and follow up system should not be contracted to outside persons. \nThe principal function is to ensure that all findings resulting from the independent audit are \ncorrected in a timely manner and to enable the accountable manager to remain properly \ninformed of the state of compliance. Apart from rectification of findings the accountable \nmanager should hold routine meetings to check progress on rectification except that in the large \ntraining organisation such meetings may be delegated on a day to day basis to the quality \nmanager as long as the accountable manager meets at least once per year with the senior staff \ninvolved to review the overall performance. \n147.A.135 Examinations \nRegulation (EU) 2023/989 \n(a) The examination staff shall ensure the security of all questions. \n(b) Any student found during a knowledge examination to be cheating or in possession of material \npertaining to the examination subject other than the examination papers and associated \nauthorised documentation shall be disqualified from taking the examination and may not take \nany examination for at least 12 months after the date of the incident. The competent authority \nshall be informed of any such incident together with the details of any enquiry within one \ncalendar month. \n(c) Any examiner found during a knowledge examination to be providing question answers to any \nstudent being examined shall be disqualified from acting as an examiner and the examination \ndeclared void.

The pre audit procedure should focus on establishing compliance with the training and \nexamination standards set out in Part-147 and Part-66. \n2. The fundamental reason for allowing a maintenance training organisation approved under Part- \n147 to sub-contract certain basic theoretical training courses is to permit the approval of \nmaintenance training organisations, which may not have the capacity to conduct training \ncourses on all Part-66 modules. \n3. The reason for allowing the subcontracting of training modules 1 to 6 and 8 to 10 only is, most \nof the related subjects can generally also be taught by training organisations not specialised in \naircraft maintenance and the practical training element as specified in 147.A.200 does not apply \nto them. On the contrary, training modules 7 and 11 to 17 are specific to aircraft maintenance \nand include the practical training element as specified in 147.A.200. The intent of the ‘limited \nsubcontracting’ option as specified in 147.A.145 is to grant Part-147 approvals only to those \norganisations having themselves at least the capacity to teach on aircraft maintenance specific \nmatters. \nGM 147.A.145(d)3 Privileges of the maintenance training \norganisation \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nIn the case of type training and examination, the reason for allowing only subcontracting to \npowerplant and avionic systems is that the related subjects can generally also be imparted by certain \norganisations specialised in these domains such as the Type Certificate Holder of the powerplant or \nthe OEMs of these avionics systems. In such a case, the type training course should make clear how \nthe interfaces with the airframe are addressed and by whom (the subcontracted organisation or the \nPart-147 organisation itself). \nAMC 147.A.145(f) Privileges of the maintenance training \norganisation \nED Decision 2015/029/R \nWhen an organisation approved to provide basic knowledge training or type training is also approved \nto provide type examination in the cases where type training is not required, appropriate procedures \nin the MTOE should be developed and approved, including: \n− The development and the conduct of the type examination; \n− The qualification of the examiners and their currency. \nIn particular, emphasis should be put when such an examination is not regularly conducted or when \nthe examiners are not normally involved in aircraft or activities with technology corresponding to the \naircraft type subject to examination. An example would be the case of an organisation providing basic \nknowledge training only for the B1.1 license. This organisation should justify how they run type \nexaminations for single piston-engine helicopters in the case of a B1.4 licence. ",

A meeting should be arranged between the applicant and the Member State who issue Part- \n147 approvals to determine if the applicant's training activities justify the investigation for issue \nof Part-147 approval and to ensure that the applicant understands what needs to be done for \nPart-147 approval. This meeting is not intended to establish compliance but rather to see if the \nactivity is a Part-147 activity. \n2. Assuming that the applicant's activities come within the scope of Part-147 approval, instructions \nshould be sent to the competent authority staff requesting that an audit of the applicant be \ncarried out and when satisfied that compliance has been established, a recommendation for \nthe issue of approval should be submitted to the competent authority staff who grant approval \nunless these are the same staff. The competent authority should determine how and by whom \nthe audit shall be conducted. For example, if the applicant is a large training organisation, it will \nbe necessary to determine whether one large team audit or a short series of small team audits \nor a long series of single person audits is most appropriate for the particular situation. A further \nconsideration in the case of a combined Part-145/147 organisation is the possibility to combine \nthe audits. \n3. Where it is intended that the maintenance training organisation may conduct training and \nexaminations away from the maintenance training organisation address(es) in accordance with \n147.A.145(c), then a sample audit should be carried out by the competent authority from time \nto time of the process to ensure that procedures are followed. For practical reasons such sample \naudits will need to be carried out when training is being conducted away from the maintenance \ntraining organisation address(es). \n4. The auditing surveyor should ensure that they are always accompanied throughout the audit \nby a senior member of the organisation making application for Part-147 approval. Normally this \nshould be the proposed quality manager. The reason for being accompanied is to ensure that \nthe organisation is fully aware of any findings during the audit. In any case, the proposed quality ",
    " \nAnnex IV (Part-147) \nSECTION B — PROCEDURES FOR \nCOMPETENT AUTHORITIES  Page 957 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nmanager/senior member of the organisation should be debriefed at the end of the audit visit \non the findings made during the audit. \n5. There will be occasions when the auditing surveyor may find situations in the applicant's \norganisation on which he/she is unsure about compliance. In this case, the organisation should \nbe informed about possible non-compliance at the time of audit and the fact that the situation \nwill be reviewed before a decision is made. The organisation should be informed of the decision \nwithin 2 weeks of the audit visit in writing if the decision is a confirmation of non-compliance. \nIf the decision is a finding of being in compliance, a verbal confirmation to the organisation will \nsuffice. \n6. A change of name of the maintenance training organisation requires the organisation to submit \na new application as a matter of urgency stating that only the name of the organisation has \nchanged including a copy of the organisation exposition with the new name. Upon receipt of \nthe application and the organisation exposition, the competent authority should reissue the \napproval certificate valid only up to the current expiry date. \n7. A name change alone does not require the competent authority to audit the organisation, \nunless there is evidence that other aspects of the maintenance training organisation have \nchanged. \n8. A change of accountable manager requires the maintenance training organisation to submit \nsuch fact to the competent authority as a matter of urgency together with the amendment to \nthe accountable manager exposition statement. \n9. A change of any of the senior personnel specified in 147.A.105(b) requires the maintenance \ntraining organisation to submit a Form 4 in respect of the particular person. If satisfied that the \nqualifications and experience meet the standard required by Part-147, the competent authority \nshould indicate acceptance in writing to the maintenance training organisation. \n10. A change in the maintenance training organisation’s exposition requires the competent \nauthority to establish that the procedures specified in the exposition are in compliance with \nPart-147 and then to establish if these are the same procedures intended for use within the \ntraining facility. \n11. Any change of location of the maintenance training organisation requires the organisation to \nmake a new application to the competent authority together with the submission of an \namended exposition. The competent authority should follow the procedure specified in \n147.B.110(a) and (b) in so far as the change affects such procedure before issuing a new Part- \n147 approval certificate. \n12. The complete or partial reorganisation of a training organisation should require the re-audit of \nthose elements that have changed. \n13. Any additional basic or aircraft type training courses requires the maintenance training \norganisation to make a new application to the competent authority together with the \nsubmission of an amended exposition. For basic training extensions, an additional sample of \nnew examination questions relevant to the modules associated with the extension being sought \nwill be required to be submitted. The competent authority should follow the procedure of \nparagraph 11 in so far as the change affects such procedures unless the competent authority is \nsatisfied that the maintenance training organisation has a well-controlled procedure to qualify \nsuch change when it is not necessary to conduct the audit elements of the paragraph 11 \nprocedure.

Care should be taken when tape is used to cover \nelectrical connections or fluid fittings/openings because adhesive residues can insulate \nelectrical connections and contaminate hydraulic or fuel units. \n(5) verify that the release certificate accompanying each new component satisfies the \nrelease requirements established in point 21.A.307 of Annex I (Part 21) and point \n21L.A.193 of Annex Ib (Part 21 Light) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 as applicable in \nrelation to the particular product on which the component is being installed. \n(d) Items (e.g. fasteners) purchased in batches should be supplied in a package. The packaging \nshould state the applicable specification/standard, P/N, batch number, and the quantity of the \nitems. The documentation that accompanies the material should contain the applicable \nspecification/standard, P/N, batch number, supplied quantity, and the manufacturing sources. \nIf the material is acquired from different batches, acceptance documentation for each batch \nshould be provided. \nGM2 M.A.501(b) Classification and installation \nED Decision 2021/009/R \nINSTALLATION OF COMPONENTS \nComponents, standard parts and materials should only be installed when they are specified in the \napplicable maintenance data as specified in M.A.401(b). So, a component, standard part and material \ncan only be installed after having checked the applicable maintenance data. \nThis check should ensure that the part number, modification status, limitations, etc. of the \ncomponent, standard part or material are the ones specified in the applicable maintenance data of \nthe particular aircraft or component where the component, standard part or material is going to be \ninstalled. When the installation is performed outside a maintenance organisation, that is by the \npersons referred to in M.A.801(b)(1), M.A.801(b)(2), or M.A.801(c), then these persons are \nresponsible to perform this check before installation. When the installation is performed by a Part-M \nSubpart F organisation or an organisation approved in accordance with Part CAO, then the \norganisation has to establish procedures to ensure that this check is performed before installation.

In that case, it should be stated in the paragraph where \nthe current list of aircraft managed is available for consultation. \n3. A new Part 6 is added to include the continuing airworthiness management procedures: \nPART 6 — CONTINUING AIRWORTHINESS PROCEDURES FOR AIRCRAFT REFERRED TO IN T.A.101 \n6.1 CONTINUING AIRWORTHINESS MANAGEMENT \n6.1.1 Aircraft continuing airworthiness records system \na) Aircraft continuing airworthiness records system and aircraft technical log \nThis section should describe the system used by the CAMO to manage the aircraft’s \ncontinuing airworthiness records. \nb) Minimum equipment list (MEL) procedures \nThis section should describe the specific responsibilities of the CAMO with regard \nto the issue, update, use and management of the MEL, if applicable to the aircraft. \n6.1.2 Aircraft maintenance programme \nThis paragraph should identify the State of Registry requirements for the maintenance \nprogramme, and should describe how the procedure established by the CAMO satisfies \nthose requirements. This procedure should address the specific responsibilities of the \nCAMO with regard to the development, update, approval or acceptance and \nmanagement of the maintenance programme. The sources for the maintenance \nprogramme and the mandatory tasks should be clearly identified. \n6.1.3 Time and continuing airworthiness records, responsibilities, retention and access \na) Recording of hours and cycles \nThe recording of flight hours and cycles is essential for the planning of maintenance \ntasks. This paragraph should describe how the CAMO has access to the current \nflight hours and cycles information and how this information is processed in the \norganisation. \nb) Records \nThis paragraph should describe in detail the type of documents that are required \nto be recorded and the recording-period requirements for each document. This \ncan be provided by a table or series of tables that should include the following: \n− family of document (if necessary), \n− name of document, \n− retention period, \n− responsible person for retention, \n− place of retention. ",
    " \nAnnex Va (Part-T) \nAPPENDICES TO AMCs AND GM TO \nANNEX Va (Part-T)  Page 997 of 1265| Jul 2024 \nc) Preservation of records \nThis paragraph should set out the means to protect the records from fire, floods, \netc., as well as the specific procedures in place to guarantee that the records will \nnot be altered during the retention period [especially for the computer records]. \nd) Transfer of continuing airworthiness records \nTransfer-in: \nThis paragraph should describe the procedure for the acquisition of the necessary \ncontinuing airworthiness records by the CAMO before leasing the aircraft and who \nis responsible for its implementation. The records should include the applicable \nstatus of compliance, release to service, approval and substantiating data for \nmodifications and repairs, compliance with mandatory information, etc. \nTransfer-out: \nThis paragraph should describe the procedure for the transfer of records in case of \ntransfer of the aircraft to another organisation. In particular, it should specify \nwhich records have to be transferred and who is responsible for the coordination \n[if necessary] of the transfer. \n6.1.4 Accomplishment and control of mandatory safety information (MSI) issued by the State \nof Registry and the Agency \nThis paragraph should identify the MSI requirements issued by the State of Registry and \nthe Agency. Additionally, it should demonstrate that the CAMO has a comprehensive \nsystem for the management of MSI including airworthiness directives (ADs) issued by the \nState of Registry and the Agency. It may, for instance, include the following \nsubparagraphs: \na) MSI acquisition \nThis paragraph should specify the sources for the MSI (State of Registry, \nmanufacturer, type certificate holder, the Agency). \nb) MSI decision \nThis paragraph should describe how and by whom the MSI is analysed. It should \nalso describe the decision-making process in case the MSI of the State of Registry \nconflicts with the MSI issued by the Agency or any EU airworthiness or operational \nrequirement. This paragraph should also describe what kind of information is \nprovided to the contracted maintenance organisations in order to plan and \nperform the MSI. This should include, as necessary, a specific procedure for \nemergency MSI management. \nc) MSI control \nThis paragraph should specify how the organisation manages to ensure that all the \napplicable MSI is performed and that they are performed on time. This should \ninclude a closed-loop system that allows verifying that for each new or revised MSI \nand for each aircraft: \n1. the MSI is not applicable, or \n2. if the MSI is applicable: \n− the MSI is not yet performed but the time limit is not overdue, ",

In particular, the process for the issue and approval of design data for repairs and \nmodifications, the classification of repairs and modifications, and the specific \nresponsibilities of the CAMO with regard to the management and approval of any \nmodification and repair before embodiment. \n6.1.6 Defect reports \na) Analysis \nThis paragraph should describe how the defect reports provided by the contracted \nmaintenance organisations are processed by the CAMO. The analysis of these \nreports should be taken into account for the maintenance programme evolution \nand non-mandatory modification policy. \nb) Liaison with type certificate holders and regulatory authorities \nWhere a defect report shows that such defect is likely to occur to other aircraft, a \nliaison should be established with the type certificate holder and the authority that \nhas issued the type certificate so that they may take all the necessary actions. \nc) Deferred defect policy \nThis paragraph should describe the State of Registry requirements for deferred \ndefects. Defects such as cracks and structural defects are not addressed by the MEL \nand the configuration deviation list (CDL). However, it may be necessary in certain \ncases to defer the rectification of a defect. This paragraph should establish the \nprocedure to be followed in order to ensure that the deferment of any defect \nrectification will not lead to any safety concern. This will include appropriate liaison \nwith the manufacturer and with the State of Registry. \n6.1.7 Reliability programmes \nIf a reliability programme is required, this paragraph should describe appropriately the \nmanagement of a reliability programme. It should at least address the following: \n− extent and scope of the reliability programme, \n− specific organisational structure, duties and responsibilities, \n− establishment of reliability data, \n− analysis of the reliability data, \n− corrective action system (maintenance programme amendment), \n− scheduled reviews (reliability meetings with the participation of the competent \nauthority). \nThis paragraph may, where necessary, be subdivided as follows: \n(a) airframe, \nb) propulsion, ",
